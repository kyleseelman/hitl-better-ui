While Beijing says Belt and Road is mutually beneficial for it and its partners, questions have been raised about countries taking on excessive debt to build projects.\n\nFollow the New Silk Road Read more\n\nThe initial $7.3bn (£5.6bn) price tag on the Kyaukpyu deepwater port, on the western tip of Myanmar’s conflict-torn Rakhine state, set off alarm bells due to reports of troubled Chinese-backed projects in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the official and the adviser said.\n\nDeputy finance minister Set Aung, who was appointed to lead project negotiations in May, told Reuters the “project size has been tremendously scaled down“.\n\nThe revised cost would be “around $1.3bn, something that’s much more plausible for Myanmar’s use”, said Sean Turnell, economic adviser to Myanmar’s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nChina’s state-run Citic Group, the main developer of the project, said negotiations were ongoing and that the $1.3bn was to be spent on the “initial phase” of the port, adding the project was divided into four phases. It did not elaborate on plans for subsequent stages.\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said on Monday that “according to what I understand, at present both sides are having commercial negotiations” on the Kyaukpyu project.\n\nWhat is China's Belt and Road Initiative? Read more\n\nThe original plan was to develop around 10 berths at the 25-metre deep sea port to accommodate bigger oil tankers, but the size will now be revised to only two berths, Set Aung said in an interview.\n\nThe Myanmar government faces a delicate balancing act in renegotiating the project with China, analysts say.\n\nThe country is increasingly reliant on diplomatic support from Beijing as it faces western criticism over its treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine state, and needs Beijing’s help to end ethnic conflicts on its borders. But many in Myanmar are also wary of becoming too dependent on China.\n\nBeijing has pushed for strategic opportunities in Myanmar, including preferential access to the Kyaukpyu port, after being driven to all but abandon a hydroelectric project in the country amid widespread local opposition last year.\n\nKyaukpyu is an entry point for a 480 mile (770km) pipeline delivering oil and natural gas to China’s Yunnan province. That gives China an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East that avoids the strategic chokepoint of the Malacca Strait.\n\nUnder the original plan, Kyaukpyu would have had a container capacity to rival that of ports such as Manila or Valencia in Spain.\n\nConstruction on the port, and an accompanying special economic zone, which together were supposed to cost up to $10bn, was expected to start in 2018. A 4,200-acre industrial park worth $2.3bn was planned to attract textile and oil refining industries.\n\nBut Myanmar officials said the experience of Sri Lanka, where this year the government signed over to China the lease on a strategic port to pay off Chinese-backed loans used to finance it, had raised concerns the country could be walking into a debt trap.",

                        "docText": "NAYPYITAW, Myanmar (AP) — China's President Xi Jinping was heading to Myanmar on Friday for a state visit likely to deepen the countries' already close bilateral relations at a critical time.\n\nWhile the visit nominally marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Myanmar, it comes with the prospect of significantly boosting China's profile and investments in the future.\n\nChina's ambassador to Myanmar Chen Hai told Chinese journalists last week that during Xi's two-day visit, the two countries would sign agreements \"covering politics, economy, livelihoods and regional cooperation.\" Some of these are expected to expedite major infrastructure projects that will extend Beijing's strategic presence all the way to the Indian Ocean.\n\nA complicating factor is Myanmar's general election, scheduled for late 2020, since too much wheeling and dealing with China could leave Aung San Suu Kyi's government vulnerable to accusations by political opponents that it is selling out the country.\n\nThe trip will be Xi 's first to Myanmar and his first foreign visit this year. Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit Myanmar, when he signed several economic and border agreements in 2001.\n\nAmbassador Chen said that Xi will meet with Myanmar's President Win Myint, State Counselor Suu Kyi, who is the country's de facto leader, and military chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, as well as legislators and other opinion-makers.\n\nMyanmar is a linchpin of China's geopolitical ambitions, offering access to the Indian Ocean that would allow its sizable oil and gas imports from the Gulf to bypass going through the Strait of Malacca, and serving as a bridge to South Asia and beyond in Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative to build railroads, highways, ports and other infrastructure connecting China with other points in Asia and into Europe and Africa.\n\nChina serves as a no-questions-asked ally to Myanmar, giving it diplomatic cover as the country faces widespread condemnation over its human rights record. The reaction to its brutal counterinsurgency campaign that drove more than 700,000 members of the country's Muslim Rohingya minority to flee for safety in neighboring Bangladesh threatens it with economic sanctions from Western nations.\n\nLast month a case charging Myanmar with genocide came before the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands, virtually ratifying the Southeast Asian country's near-pariah status.\n\nChina for years has defended Myanmar in forums such as the United Nations, and Myanmar has returned the favor by following Beijing's positions on issue such as China's claims over territory in the South China Sea.\n\nMore importantly, China as a top investor and trade partner with Myanmar offers economic insurance if Western nations do impose sanctions.\n\nJust days before Suu Kyi went to The Hague in December to lead her country's delegation at the initial hearings of the International Court of Justice, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with her for talks. The court holds another hearing next week.\n\n“Xi is visiting Myanmar at the very right time. And Myanmar wants to show the Western world that China is backing them. Just before the ICJ hearings in December 2019, China's FM visited and now before issuance of provisional measures, Xi is going to visit,” Germany-based Rohingya activist Nay San Lwin told The Associated Press. \"I think it is not a coincidence. Myanmar wanted to say to the West to be careful if you impose any sanctions.\"\n\nBeijing in recent years has waged a strong battle with Washington for influence in Southeast Asia.\n\nChina also uses it influence with various Myanmar ethnic rebel groups based along the countries' border who are battling battle for autonomy from the central government.\n\nWhile China has promoted peace talks between the the rebels and Myanmar's government, its close ties with some of the rebel groups allows it to retain the option of threatening violence by using ethnic guerrillas as proxies.\n\nWhat appears to be a mutually beneficial quid pro quo with China won't necessarily play well domestically, a worry for Suu Kyi and her ruling National League for Democracy party as it faces new elections. There has always been a strong undercurrent of anti-Chinese sentiment in Myanmar, and it is boosted by sometimes heavy-handed implementation of Chinese-backed projects that run roughshod over local communities, provoking allegations of land-grabbing, environmental damage and selling out the country's resources.\n\nEven Myanmar's previous military-backed government was forced by popular demand to suspend plans for the massive $3.6 billion Myitsone hydroelectric dam project in 2011, but it has not been canceled. Activists plan a protest against the project on Saturday outside the Chinese Embassy in Yangon.\n\nHurdles may be cleared during Xi's visit to give the go-ahead to another project arguably more important to Beijing, the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone on the Bay of Bengal. With a deep-water port, it serves as one end of a 1,700-kilometer- (1,055-mile-) long China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a major link in the Belt and Road Initiative whose other end is in China's Yunnan province.\n\nIt includes cross-border oil and gas pipelines that have been operating for years, and a major railway is planned, though its projected high cost has given pause.\n\nAmnesty International is among the critics of the Chinese-assisted projects.\n\n\"With major economic and infrastructure agreements expected to be signed during President Xi's visit, the absolute lack of transparency over such agreements is deeply disturbing,\" the human rights group said in a statement Thursday. “Investment in infrastructure can help raise living standards and realize human rights through improved access to basic services and employment.”\n\n“But these benefits are not delivered if those who bear the heaviest cost — the women, men, and children whose homes, health, livelihoods are be affected — are not adequately consulted before construction starts and protected from potential harm. Human rights, transparency, and consultation with communities should be at the heart of these projects.”\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press writer Grant Peck in Bangkok contributed to this report.",

REUTERS/Ann Wang\n\nMaking his first visit to the Southeast Asian country as leader, and the first of any Chinese president in 19 years, analysts say Xi will bid to revive stalled multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects central to his flagship Belt and Road Initiative described as a “21st century Silk Road”.\n\nHe is scheduled to meet state counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and army chief Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Naypyitaw, as well with the heads of minor political parties.\n\nThe two countries have had a historically sometimes fraught relationship, with many in Myanmar suspicious of the tremendous sway China holds over its smaller neighbor.\n\nRelations have warmed since China avoided joining in the international condemnation of Myanmar after a military campaign in 2017 forced more than 730,000 Rohingya to flee across the border to Bangladesh.\n\nU.N. officials said the Myanmar military offensive was executed with “genocidal intent”, though Myanmar says it was a legitimate counter-insurgency operation launched after militant attacks on security forces.\n\nA permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China has defended Myanmar on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal.\n\nChina is the second biggest investor in Myanmar, behind only Singapore, according to data published by the World Bank. Myanmar’s exports to China, its largest trading partner, were worth $5.5 billion in 2018, while imports were worth $6.2 billion.\n\n“No other country is investing in Myanmar except China,” said Hla Kyaw Zaw, a political analyst based in Yunnan province on the Myanmar-China border. “China can negotiate a good deal with Myanmar,” she said.\n\nChinese vice foreign minister Luo Zhaohui told reporters in Beijing on Friday the purpose of the visit was to strengthen relations, deepen Belt and Road co-operation and “materialize” the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a plan for a y-shaped corridor of projects connecting China with the Indian Ocean.\n\n“Preparations are underway and you will see the historic outcomes and influence of this historic visit,” Luo said.\n\n‘LIKE WATER IN THEIR HANDS’\n\nChinese and Myanmar flags fluttered side by side along the roads in the capital, Naypyitaw, on Thursday ahead of Xi’s arrival, alongside banners bearing his portrait. Municipal staff cleaned the roads and tended to the gardens, while some hotels hung welcoming signs.\n\nChinese authorities, including the ministry of information and embassy, have organized a series of events celebrating the Myanmar-China relationship, which marks its 70th anniversary this year, in the commercial capital of Yangon in recent days.\n\nAt one event on Tuesday, Myanmar’s Minister for International Cooperation Kyaw Tin acknowledged concerns over the relationship before Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party came to power after a landslide election win in 2015.\n\n“But the relationship between Myanmar and China is stronger and closer than before and we are building trust between our countries,” he said. “It will be a very successful visit. It will bring lots of benefits.”\n\nBut Chinese megaprojects carry political risk in Myanmar, viewed as wrecking the environment and causing large-scale displacement of villagers.\n\nOn the agenda at the weekend’s talks are expected to be a deep-sea port in Rakhine state that was scaled down in 2018 over fears of a debt-trap and a now-suspended Chinese-backed $3.6 billion mega dam in the northern Kachin state, which would have flooded an area the size of Singapore, displacing tens of thousands of people.\n\nWhile Suu Kyi, a longtime democracy activist and Nobel laureate, once publicly criticized the dam, more recently she has urged ethnic Kachin people to keep an open mind.\n\nWorkers put up flags a day before Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Myanmar in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, January 16, 2020.

                        "docText": "After the Soviet Union’s demise, China has had an unambiguous view that there will be only two global superpowers, China and the US, in that order. Over the last three decades, it has singularly worked at making this a reality. Consider two sets of facts.First, GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) measured in current prices, culled out from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook. In 1980, China’s was at $304 billion. Believe it or not, India ’s was 26% higher at $383 billion. Fast forward to 2019. China’s GDP (at PPP) in current prices was $27.3 trillion, which was almost 2.5 times that of India’s at $11 trillion. In plain English, we meandered along while China raced ahead.Second, examine military expenditure at current prices, which is from the World Bank. In 1990, China’s was $10.1billion. Ours was mildly larger at $10.5 billion. By 2018, China’s annual military spend had risen to $250 billion, which was 3.75 times ours at $66.5 billion. Simply put, China has leveraged its stupendous economic growth over the last three decades to build a modern military juggernaut that is by far the largest in Asia, and the second largest in the world after the US.China has been strategically encircling India. It has invested in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that involves expressways from the Pakistan-China border down to the newly constructed deep-water port of Gwadar in Balochistan. Though the project has been mired with delays and cost overruns, the fact is that when operational, China will have a leased deep-water port in the Persian Gulf. It won’t be only for trade.Go next to Hambantota on the Indian Ocean. A broke government of Sri Lanka, indebted to the neck thanks to Mahinda Rajapaksa’s never-ending loans from China, was forced to hand over the port and 15,000 acres of surrounding land to China on a 99-year lease. Though meant for civilian use, China will twist Sri Lanka to accede to setting up military and naval facilities, thus having a strategically located port on the Indian Ocean.Now go up north to Myanmar’s deep-water port of Kyaukpyu or Sittwe. China has built two pipelines for crude oil and for natural gas, running for 771km up the Irrawaddy up to the border at Ruili before turning east to Kunming. The pipelines not only ‘free’ China from potential threats along the Straits of Malacca, but serve to have Myanmar in its pocket.Then move to the Tibetan plateau. With the Zangmu dam built on the Yarlung Tsangpo, China has reduced the Brahmaputra’s waterflow into India. More dams are in the offing. Moreover, enjoying the advantage of the plateau, China has extended allweather roads right up to its side of the Line of Actual Control (LoAC), built airstrips, and significantly expanded its military presence, especially after the Dokalam stand-off in 2017.The latest infringement in the Galwan Valley resulting in 20 Indian casualties is not the only one this year. There have been at least six instances of Chinese ingress in Ladakh: at Chushul, Pangong Tso, three in the Galwan Valley and one in the Depsang Plains — where China now occupies the heights looking on to our Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi road.It is difficult to predict whether China will give up all the infringed territories and return to its side of the Lo-AC. I suspect not, especially the newly occupied strategic heights.This is not a ‘let us test the Indians and then pull back’ exercise. It looks like ‘let us capture key points and hold’. Why? Because Xi Jinping wants to teach India a lesson.We have rightly stayed away from his ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative. We are a part of the Quad — a strategic information exchange and military cooperation forum between the US, Australia, Japan and India. For all the tête-à-tête between Xi and Narendra Modi , we are not in China’s pocket. Instead, we are a huge bordering nation.China is not, and will never be, a friend. It is forever a potential enemy. In that context, how should we react? We can’t wish away Chinese imports. But we can certainly cancel Chinese infrastructure projects. We should be ultra-careful about Chinese telecom hardware. We should be on high alert for Chinese hacking. Most importantly, while diplomatically negotiating, we must quickly increase our military resources on the border. That includes rapid air support capabilities, mortars, Howitzers and high-altitude artillery, missile defence systems, and more heavily armed better equipped feet on the ground.We have the newly formed Mountain Strike Corps. Can we not increase the size of the Corps, and position fully armed advance units nearer the borders? Can we move from purely defending the LoAC to ‘tit-for-tat’? If you ingress, I too will do so at your weak points. Can we see some real action along these lines? Or else we will have to relive the sorry picture of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain alighting from a plane on September 30, 1938 claiming that he had brought ‘peace for our time’. Eleven months later, Adolf Hitler invaded Poland.",

REUTERS/Stringer\n\nHailed by China as a symbol of “mutually beneficial cooperation”, the pipeline has become a target for public anger over perceptions Beijing is backing the junta that seized power in a Feb. 1 coup.\n\nThe rise in anti-China sentiment has raised questions in Myanmar business circles and in China, not only over the surge of Chinese investment in recent years but for billions of dollars earmarked for a strategic neighbour on Beijing’s “Belt and Road” infrastructure plan.\n\n“Chinese business, Out! Out!,” the dozen or so protesters shouted in Mandalay city, a staging point on pipelines across Myanmar from the Indian Ocean to China. Social media carried many more threats.\n\nThe gas pipeline, which carries gas from Myanmar’s offshore fields, opened in 2013, as Myanmar’s military was starting democratic reforms. The $1.5 billion 770-km (480 mile) oil pipe alongside, bringing crude mainly from the Middle East, started in 2017 under the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now detained and facing an array of charges.\n\nA PetroChina official who declined to be identified said there had been no problems with the operation of the oil pipeline - the only source of crude for the state energy giant’s refinery in Kunming, Yunnan province.\n\nProtests over the pipeline flared after a Myanmar government document leaked from a Feb. 24 meeting showed Chinese officials had asked Myanmar’s junta to provide better security - and intelligence on ethnic minority armed groups on the pipeline route.\n\nReuters was unable to reach officials in Myanmar for comment on the document.\n\n“Safeguarding the security of bilateral cooperation projects is the common responsibility of both China and Myanmar,” China’s foreign ministry said in response to questions on the document, reiterating its call for “all sides in Myanmar to exercise calm and restraint” and to resolve their differences.\n\n“This would also benefit the secure operations of bilateral cooperation projects,” it said.\n\nChina did not immediately respond to a question on anti-China sentiment.\n\nHOSTILE OPINION\n\nBillions of dollars had been earmarked for such projects, including an economic corridor ending at a $1.3 billion deepwater port, industrial zones, a new city next to the commercial hub of Yangon and a railway to the border.\n\n“Hostile public opinion will inflict long-term threats and damage to China’s plan,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.\n\nShe pointed in particular to the damage done to Beijing’s reputation over the Myitsone Dam project, which was shelved in 2011 amid a local outcry - prompting a concerted effort by China to cultivate the public as well as political leaders.\n\n“Public opinion has been treated as a priority for China’s policy in Myanmar,” she said.\n\nEfforts in recent years included everything from donating school backpacks to sponsoring inspection trips to China for officials - though a 2018 survey in Myanmar still found an “explicit bias” against Chinese investments.\n\nChina had also tried to keep close to Suu Kyi, while maintaining ties to the army that overthrew her.\n\nBalancing the relationship has become even more precarious.\n\nWhile Western countries have condemned the coup, China has not even described it as one - in line with the generals’ wishes. Its call for restraint from both sides draws scorn from opponents of the coup who point to the killing of more than 60 protesters. One policeman has died, the army says.\n\n“China shame on you. Stop supporting the theft of a nation,” read one protest placard outside the Chinese embassy before Myanmar security forces cordoned it off.\n\nSUSPICIONS\n\nNo matter how outlandish, allegations of Chinese involvement have swirled on social media.\n\nSome said they had seen soldiers with Chinese features or heard some speaking Mandarin. Suspicions were raised by an increase in night-time flights to China - flights the state airline said carried seafood for the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nUnsubstantiated claims surfaced that the planes were bringing in soldiers or technicians to install an internet firewall - an idea dismissed by the junta and described as “nonsense” by the Chinese ambassador.\n\nConcerns that anti-Beijing sentiment could turn on Chinese businesses has prompted some to reconsider their positions - especially as anti-coup protests and strikes strangle the economy.\n\n“They can only vent on the Chinese people on the ground,” said one Chinese businessman who gave his name as Ran and is now seeking a way out - while saying he had not faced any personal attacks.\n\nMyanmar also has a substantial minority with Chinese origins, whose older members remember anti-Chinese riots in 1967 in which an estimated 30 people were killed. Some younger members, however, have taken a conspicuous stand with the protesters.\n\n“Our elders worry about the Sinophobic posts - things on Facebook like ‘the Chinese will be the first people to be beaten’ but it’s only a small number of people making them,” said Aung Aung, 23, a founder of the Young Burmese-Chinese Association.\n\n“The people know where we stand. We want to get democracy back.”",

The meeting starting Thursday brings together leaders or envoys from three dozen countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Serbia, Myanmar and Kenya.\n\nDebt “is going to be part of the prime minister’s focus at the forum,” said Billenne Seyoum, press secretary for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia.\n\nIn a meeting Wednesday, Xi told Abiy that Beijing had forgiven interest due on loans owed by Ethiopia through the end of 2018, the prime minister’s office announced on its Facebook page.

But countries including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have canceled or renegotiated railways and other projects they concluded were too expensive or unproductive.\n\nMost projects are built by Chinese state-owned companies and financed with loans from government banks at commercial interest rates that critics say could leave borrowers mired in debt they cannot repay.\n\nBeijing also faces grumbling by the United States, Japan, India and Russia that Belt and Road is a tool to build a China-centered political structure and erode their influence. American officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have told countries considering Belt and Road projects to look closely at Beijing’s motives and warned about debt.\n\n“BRI project financing will be a main topic for discussion” at the forum, said James Su of research firm Fitch Solutions in an email. He said Chinese leaders appear ready to discuss “more sustainable” financing to ease fears of a “debt trap.”\n\n“We see this as crucial for China as it seeks to reduce negative sentiment surrounding the initiative,” said Su.\n\nBeijing has given some borrowers more time to repay or made other concessions. Ethiopia’s Abiy reached agreement in September to extend repayment for a $4 billion railway linking his country with neighboring Djibouti from 10 years to 30 years.\n\nPakistan, which is building 22 Belt and Road projects including power plants and highways, has run into a debt crunch that forced it to ask the International Monetary Fund for an $8 billion bailout. But authorities say Prime Minister Imran Khan has no plans to ask China to renegotiate their deals during this week’s forum.\n\nChina has invested $13 billion in Pakistan and lent $6 billion for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a series of 22 projects.\n\nWashington argues the IMF shouldn’t help Pakistani repay Chinese lenders.\n\nDespite debt concerns, Ethiopia and other governments express support for Belt and Road and want more Chinese financing.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta plans to pursue a $3.7 billion loan from Beijing this week to extend a Chinese-built railway, his government’s ambassador to Beijing, Sarah Serem, told The Nation newspaper.\n\nThat is despite complaints the railway is unproductive and cannot pay for itself. The 962-kilometer (597-mile) project is intended to link Kenya with central Africa and Congo.\n\nKenya owes Chinese banks $3.2 billion for its first 472-kilometer (293-mile) link from the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa to the capital, Nairobi. Kenya is due to borrow almost $10 billion from Beijing for the full project.\n\nThe Nation said in September that Kenyatta wants China to pay for half of the next stage but other news reports said Beijing balked at that.\n\nBeijing scored a diplomatic coup in March when Italy became the first member of the Group of Seven major economies, which includes the United States, to sign an agreement to support Belt and Road.\n\nThe number of countries that have signed at least preliminary Belt and Road agreements has risen to 115 from 64 in 2013, according to the Chinese government.\n\n“As its relationship with the U.S. has soured, China is increasingly looking to the BRI to provide a tool for geopolitical influence,” said Moody’s analysts in a report in January.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, a 42-kilometer (26-mile) Chinese-built highway in Montenegro has prompted complaints the 810 million euro ($910 million) project is costly and wasteful.\n\n“The project is completely unfavorable for Montenegro,” said Ivan Kekovic, a civil engineer in Podgorica, the country’s capital.\n\nMontenegrin President Milo Djukanovic defended the deal, saying in an interview any contractors could bid but only Chinese companies submitted concrete proposals.\n\nIn the Indian Ocean, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih of the Maldives says he wants to review the country’s Belt and Road projects and debt.\n\nChinese officials say Beijing is learning from experience and examining borrowers closely to make sure they can repay loans.\n\nPossibly due to tighter scrutiny, the number of new Belt and Road projects has plunged.\n\nThe total value of new contracts fell 42 percent in the first half of 2018 compared with a year earlier, according to Moody’s.\n\n___\n\nMunir Ahmed in Islamabad, Elias Meseret in Addis Ababa, Tom Odula in Nairobi, Roshan Sedhai in Kathmandu, Dusan Stojanovic in Belgrade and Stephen Wright in Jakarta contributed.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

I was desperate for development work, but ultimately the Chinese agreed to build it,\" Rajapaksa said in an interview with Singapore's Straits Times in 2010\n\nThe venture was considered economically unviable and indeed, in the years that followed, the port sat empty and neglected, and Sri Lanka's debt ballooned\n\nBut India's economic foresight might have cost it in terms of strategic geopolitics, since the debt incurred on the port and the surrounding infrastructure undertakings now belong to its great rival.\n\nChina's official licensing of the port in December last year gives it yet another point of access over a key shipping route, and the prospect of providing it with a sizeable presence in India's immediate backyard and traditional sphere of influence, bringing China closer to India's shores than New Delhi might like.\n\nSri Lankan dancers perform at the site of the Hambantota port during a ceremony marking the first phase of construction, August 15, 2010.\n\nMoreover, Sri Lanka's decision to sign a 99-year lease with a Chinese state-owned company for the Hambantota port to service some of the billions it owes to Beijing has some observers concerned other developing nations doing business with China as part of China's One Belt One Road initiative might fall into similar financial straits.\n\nA trap, they warn, that may well have them owing more than just money to Beijing.\n\n\"China is, in many cases, the only party with the interest and the capital to deliver on these projects,\" said Jeff Smith, a research fellow on South Asia at the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC. \"The relevant question for everyone is: at what cost?\"\n\n'A determined strategy by China'\n\nChina has for decades invested in Sri Lanka, particularly during moments in recent history when much of the international community held off\n\nJeff Smith points out that along with the Hambantota port investments, Beijing loaned Sri Lanka $200 million in 2010 for a second international airport and a year later a further $810 million for the \"second phase of the port project.\"\n\nThere was more. $272 million for a railway in 2013 and more than $1 billion for the Colombo Port City project, ventures that hired mostly Chinese workers (one Sri Lankan report put the number of Chinese workers dedicated to projects in 2009 at 25,000 ), and all with money Sri Lanka could barely afford to repay.\n\nAfter an equity swap, an IMF bailout and more control over the projects ceded to Beijing, the terms of the debt were restructured, giving Sri Lanka some breathing space.\n\nIn 2017, however, the Hambantota port proved too costly for Sri Lanka to sustain.\n\n\"They (the Chinese) called in the debt, and the debt has been paid by Sri Lanka giving them the (Hambantota) port. That port then gives them not only a strategic access point into India's sphere of influence through which China can deploy its naval forces, but it also gives China an advantageous position to export its goods into India's economic sphere, so it's achieved a number of strategic aims in that regard,\" said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Sydney.\n\n\"This is part of a determined strategy by China to extend its influence across the Indian Ocean at the expense of India and it's using Sri Lanka to achieve it,\" he said.\n\nDetails of the new agreement between China and Sri Lanka have not been made public.\n\nThe port is an \"important project aimed at spurring local economic growth based on equality and mutual benefits,\" according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It declined to answer further when asked by reporters.\n\nConstruction workers operate heavy equipment at the base of Sri Lanka's Hambantota port August 1, 2010. Some 350 Chinese staff helped in the first phase of construction.\n\n'Creating demand for Chinese goods'\n\nChina's claiming of controlling stakes in strategic ports along critical shipping lanes -- what analysts have taken to referring to as its \"string of pearls\" -- beginning at the Straits of Malacca and dotting the Indian Ocean, should signal Beijing's ultimate ambitions, said Davis.\n\n\"There's a bigger picture here, that the more you invest in the Belt and Road initiative, the more the Chinese are in a position to force your country to align politically in terms of policy,\" Davis told CNN.\n\n\"So you become dependent on their investment and their largesse, and you're less likely to be critical of them and you're more likely to accommodate their interests strategically.\"\n\nBeijing's other potential partners are finding difficulty with some of their own joint projects.\n\nIn Myanmar, a $3.6 billion dam project has stalled. The then-military backed government suspended work on the Myitsone dam in the north of the country in 2011, with talks regarding its future ongoing.\n\nPakistan withdrew from a $14 billion agreement with China for a dam last November because the conditions of the deal included China taking ownership of the project and were \"not doable and against our interests,\" Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority chairman Muzammil Hussain was quoted as saying. Like Nepal, Pakistan has since indicated it would also look to shoulder the cost of the dam rather than go to an outside investor.\n\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed to be unaware of this when asked about the situation by reporters in Beijing in December. The country's top economic planning agency later said that the two countries were discussing cooperating on the dam project but that there'd been no discussion of proposals to move it forward. The agency said \"Pakistan media's reporting on this project has been inaccurate, or only represented the views of certain officials.\"\n\nBut China is still spending in Pakistan. It is building a hydroelectric power station in the Rawalpindi district, and it is developing the port of Gwadar , strategically located on the Arabian Sea.\n\nChina's trade deal with the Maldives government included investments in developing the international airport and a bridge, but the Maldives in return has taken on a significant number of controversial loan obligations.\n\nLast July, former President Mohamed Nasheed said the loan interest the traditionally Indian ally pays to service its foreign debt to China is more than 20% of the country's budget. He said that part of the deal included China's receipt of 16 \"strategically located islands\" in navigation sea-lanes.\n\nA Sri Lankan soldier walks past a billboard bearing portraits of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse, ahead's of Xi's visit to the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, September 15, 2014.\n\nDean Cheng, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, said that the initial wave of Chinese investments in the Indian Ocean, the so-called string of pearls, was largely driven by economic considerations. The investments, he said, \"would facilitate economic growth, which would benefit Chinese companies. Moreover, the construction projects would entail Chinese workers (a feature of most Chinese projects abroad, bringing their own work force), and create a demand base for Chinese goods.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said the Chinese are clearly intent on creating a friendly political network of states. \"There's nothing inherently dangerous about political considerations in economic investments,\" he told CNN. \"It would be foolish to think that any state is wholly driven by economic considerations.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Leaders attend China's Belt and Road Forum Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Leaders attend China's Belt and Road Forum 01:43\n\nWhither India?\n\nThe ever-encroaching Chinese presence into India's sphere of political and economic influence has been noted, but so far, says Manoj Joshi, New Delhi purports to be unruffled, as long as Hambantota remains a commercial port, and no Chinese naval vessels suddenly appear in the vicinity.\n\n\"In 2014 a Chinese submarine was spotted in Colombo harbor and that was the first time we saw that and the Indian side was a bit concerned,\" said Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. At the time Indian defense officials expressed \"serious concern\" to their Sri Lankan counterpart , and naval chiefs from both countries met to discuss the incidents. Then-Defense Minister Arun Jaitley said the government \"keeps a constant watch on all developments concerning our national security and economic interests and takes necessary measures to safeguard them.\"\n\nA Sri Lankan commando stands guard on the Hambantota construction site, November 18, 2010.\n\n\"It's geopolitical competition and India sees itself as the foremost nation in Asia and with the Chinese building a port, building and airport, building roads in Sri Lanka, they've emerged as big investors there and the Indians are obviously feeling somewhat nervous because India doesn't have those kind of resources to compete with,\" Joshi told CNN.\n\n\"What we worry about is, we already have a border problem with China and now that competition goes to the Indian Ocean region. That could be against our interests.\"\n\nIndia and China share a 2,500 mile-long border, and have regularly faced off over perceived intrusions on each other's terrain as well as activity in uninhabited territory claimed by China and Bhutan, an Indian ally.\n\n\"Everybody talks about China and India being major rivals, I think China doesn't see India as a genuine long-term rival, I think it looks at India and sees a classic case of democracy gone wrong,\" said Yvonne Chiu, assistant professor in the politics department at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nIndia is incredibly corrupt , its infrastructure is terrible, and it is riddled with religious and demographic problems,\" she told CNN. \"Except it is very large. It does have a big population as well and it's on the border. So it's a regional rival, but I don't think they take India seriously as a global rival.\"\n\nSri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapakse, center, flanked by his eldest son and parliamentarian Namal Rajapakse, right, and Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne, left, tour the Hambantota construction site, November 18, 2010.\n\nFor its part, India is now taking an active interest in Hambantota. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to be in talks with Sri Lanka about taking over the airport near the port, which was built using Chinese funds that Beijing itself wants to manage and is pushing for control with the Sri Lankan government. During a media briefing last November, Raveesh Kumar, an official spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, would only say that New Delhi has \"a lot of developmental projects\" going on in Sri Lanka and declined to elaborate further. Colombo has yet to make a decision involving the airport.\n\nAnd New Delhi continues to actively participate in large-scale naval exercises in regional waters alongside allies Japan, and the US, and into the future, possibly Australia too, all to Beijing's continued consternation.\n\nLast year's Malabar exercises in the Bay of Bengal involving the US, Japan and India were the largest the region has seen in more than two decades\n\n\"India, of course, remains highly influential in Sri Lanka, and would not look kindly on any effort to pressure the government on matters related to defense and national security,\" said Jeff Smith. \"Nor would the Sri Lankan military, which values its exchanges with the US .\"\n\nModi will be in Singapore in June, attending the Shangri-La dialogue , an annual meeting of defense ministers, military chiefs and defense officials from the Asia-Pacific. His keynote address will be carefully watched for words on China's maritime expansion.\n\nA White House unable to compete with China\n\nSouth Asia's problems are not on Washington's radar right now, says Hong Kong University professor Chiu. The White House has much of its focus -- along with a substantial naval presence -- directed towards the Korean Peninsula and the ongoing crisis there. And while the US is distracted, China is slowly and incrementally changing the seascape in the Asia Pacific. China claims disputed islands in the South China Sea as part of its territory and has been militarizing some of those islands, reclaiming land on others and turning sandbars into islands to assert sovereignty over the area.\n\n\"Everything that they do, like building these islands (in the South China Sea) and stuff that is illegal internationally , but nobody wants to get into a conflict over, it adds up and you have a new status quo and it's too late to do anything about it,\" Chiu said.\n\n\"China can't afford to go to war over anything ... it would most likely lose against a major power ... but these kind of small incremental things, people will let them get away with. As long as they're patient, it could have the same effect as going to war.\"\n\nEven as China has taken the long view, Dean Cheng argues it's never too late for the US and its allies to do something to counter Beijing's ambitions.\n\n\"The US, in cooperation with India, Japan and possibly the European Union, could offer alternative financing,\" Cheng said. \"They could help train local officials, lawyers, etc, to become better negotiators. They can push for transparency, especially in Chinese-sponsored institutions to make clear the terms of the loans, payback processes, as well as how contracts are rewarded.\"\n\nSri Lankan police stand guard during a protest in Colombo against the lease of the loss-making Hambantota port to China, February 1, 2017.\n\nLast October US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson gave a speech on the US relationship with India . Tillerson said it was up to New Delhi and Washington to \"do a better job leveraging our collective expertise to meet common challenges while seeking even more avenues of cooperation.\"\n\n\"We must also recognize that many Indo-Pacific nations have limited alternatives when it comes to infrastructure investment programs and financing schemes, which often fail to promote jobs or prosperity for the people they claim to help,\" Tillerson said. \"It's time to expand transparent, high-standard regional lending mechanisms, tools that will actually help nations instead of saddle them with mounting debt.\"\n\nTillerson told reporters that during the East Asia ministerial summit in August that the US had started \"a quiet conversation with others about what they were experiencing , what they need.\"\n\nHowever, he also admitted Washington's constraints. \"We will not be able to compete with the kind of terms that China offers,\" said Tillerson. \"But countries have to decide, what are they willing to pay to secure their sovereignty and their future control of their economies? And we've had those discussions with them as well.\"\n\nChina's resources are nowhere near as limited as the US and its allies, says Yvonne Chiu from the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\"Right now, it can play on multiple fronts at once,\" Chiu notes. \"And they take a very long view. If you're a power like the US, you're really far away. That distance is going to limit how much attention you can pay to the region. The US has to pick and choose and it's chosen East Asia. So, unless something really major happens, that's probably where their attention is going to stay.\"\n\nA Chinese worker at the construction site of a Chinese-funded $1.4 billion reclamation project in Colombo, Sri Lanka in October 2017.\n\nAs 2017 wrapped up, the Chinese state news agency Xinhua published a dispatch from Colombo, describing how the Hambantota port was \"now racing along a developmental fast-track.\n\nChinese and Sri Lankan workers were building a highway north of the port, along with a bridge, and the Chinese Harbor Engineering Company is negotiating with the Sri Lankan government to develop a Logistics Zone that will include a natural gas power plant and refineries, the agency reported.\n\nOn the first day of the new year, the Chinese flag flew beside Sri Lanka's at the port for the first time ever.\n\nRather than resist getting into further debt, Sri Lanka's government appears to be making more deals with China that it will may yet struggle to pay back.",

ET has reliably gathered that a consignment of Chinese 500 assault rifles, 30 universal machine guns , 70,000 rounds of ammunition and huge cache of grenades have been supplied to the insurgent group 'Arakan Army' (AA) fighting Myanmar state.Similarly, another active insurgent group United Wa State Army (UWSA) has also been found to receive arms from China, persons familiar with the development told ET. There are reports that seven insurgent groups in Myanmar are being allegedly funded by China.The consignment reached AA via beaches of Bangladesh bordering Myanmar. The arms were allegedly dropped at Monakhali beach of Bangladesh, ET has reliably gathered. AA has been allegedly targeting the India backed mega project — Kaladan Multimodal Project — at the behest of China, ET has learnt from persons tracking China's activities in the region.Kaladan project passes through the Rakhine state and AA has been targeting the project that can transform the region. The Kaladan project connects Kolkata with Sittwe port in Rakhine state by sea. In Myanmar, it will then link Sittwe port to Paletwa in Chin state via the Kaladan river boat route, and then from Paletwa by road to Mizoram. The project will help in integrating economies of eastern Myanmar with India’s north eastern states and is expected create direct and indirect jobs and augment growth opportunities, besides promote smaller traders and enable peace and development of the region, explained persons familiar with the project.The military support to AA and UWSA has exposed Chinese duplicity according to the Myanmar army. The top brass of the Myanmar army is upset that Beijing is arming the insurgent groups even while mediating between insurgent groups. In this backdrop and growing fear of debt trap, Myanmar has started pushing back against BRI projects in the country.A defence expert who follows developments in South East Asia told ET that China provides 95 per cent funding of AA besides weapons, uniforms and ammunition. AA has also been funded to safeguard China's key BRI project Kyauphyu Deep Sea Port, Beijing's entry point into Bay of Bengal.Myanmar Army has also discovered an alleged Sino-Pak axis that is supplying China made arms to AA besides Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), ET has learnt.The nexus was revealed a couple of months back following arrests by the authorities of Thailand along the Thai-Myanmar border. The Thai authorities shared details of the investigation with Myanmar’s security establishment, ET has learnt.ARSA has been accused of having connections with foreign terror groups.

                        "docText": "YANGON (Reuters) - In a muddy field in western Myanmar, hundreds of Chinese shipping containers fitted with single narrow windows stand in neat lines, empty of the refugees they were designed to host.\n\nFILE PHOTO:A boy holds a placard as hundreds of Rohingya refugees protest against their repatriation at the Unchiprang camp in Teknaf, Bangladesh November 15, 2018. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain\n\nThe gray boxes were sent by China two years ago as quick and cheap housing for some of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh during a military-led crackdown in 2017 that the United Nations said was conducted with genocidal intent.\n\nThe empty containers, situated near the town of Maungdaw in Rakhine state, reflect months of failed efforts to entice the Rohingya to return to Myanmar despite a diplomatic drive by the country’s close ally and neighbor, China.\n\nIn a sharp departure from its official policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries, China has positioned itself as the key mediator in resolving the protracted crisis. But like the Indonesian and United Nations envoys who previously attempted to mediate between the parties, China is finding the business of diplomacy tough going, with little signs that the crisis will soon be resolved.\n\nThe main sticking point is a disagreement over whether the refugees will be safe in Myanmar.\n\nMyanmar says it has created safe conditions for the Rohingya’s return, but Bangladesh and the United Nations say that fighting in Rakhine and a lack of human rights guarantees make a return for the refugees dangerous. The Rohingya, meanwhile, say they will not go back without guarantees of rights they are currently denied, including citizenship and freedom of movement.\n\nOver the past two years, Chinese officials have brokered three meetings between leaders of the two countries, made multiple visits to the sprawling refugee camps housing the Rohingya in Bangladesh, hired cattle trucks to bring returnees home and even offered cash inducements, all to no avail.\n\nStill, China says it has made progress, even if only a few hundred Rohingya have returned home so far.\n\nThe issue received fresh attention when President Xi Jinping traveled to Myanmar on Friday for a two-day state visit. In a joint statement from both countries published after the visit, China reaffirmed its willingness to continue to mediate, while Myanmar thanked China for “its understanding of the Rakhine problem, its difficulty and complications”.\n\nThe main focus of Xi’s visit was the massive Chinese infrastructure projects, including a controversial hydropower dam and a deep-sea port in Rakhine, that make Myanmar a vital link in his flagship Belt and Road Initiative aimed at expanding trade links across the world.\n\nThe two countries signed dozens of deals covering trade and infrastructure, with Myanmar agreeing to speed up implementation.\n\nWestern Myanmar, sitting between booming India and Southeast Asia, is strategically important to Beijing, offering China’s landlocked western provinces potential port access to the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.\n\n“We have facilitated and hosted three foreign minister meetings between China, Myanmar, and Bangladesh to work for an early repatriation,” Luo Zhaohui, China’s vice foreign minister told reporters on Jan. 10 in a press conference ahead of Xi’s trip. “Our efforts have paid off,” he said.\n\nBut Bangladeshi officials, Western diplomats in Yangon, and security analysts say that China is mainly concerned with shoring up its key interests in Rakhine.\n\nIn discussions with the Bangladesh government, Chinese officials emphasize the importance of developing the state rather than resolving human rights issues, according to a Bangladeshi official familiar with the discussions.\n\n“China wants to resolve the crisis,” said another Bangladeshi official. “At least, they want to start repatriation as early as possible. But they are not doing enough to oblige Myanmar to create a conducive environment for them to return.”\n\nU.N. officials and diplomats in Yangon also say that China’s efforts to broker a quick solution ignores the human rights concerns.\n\n“Their approach is wildly simplistic,” said one Yangon-based diplomat. “What we hear is China has been pushing Myanmar and Bangladesh to just get it done. What does that mean when the conditions aren’t there?”\n\nChina’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.\n\nThe Myanmar government, responding to questions from Reuters, defended the Chinese efforts.\n\nKo Ko Naing, a Myanmar official at the Ministry of Social Welfare, said China had been “helping continuously”, citing its development efforts in Rakhine.\n\n“The lack of development is more important than social cohesion,” he said. “We are doing many investments there. The roads are better.”\n\nUNCERTAIN RETURN\n\nWhile more than 730,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in 2017, hundreds of thousands are still in Myanmar, confined to camps and villages where they are denied access to healthcare and education.\n\nFresh fighting between government troops and an ethnic armed group comprised mostly of majority Rakhine Buddhists has also displaced tens of thousands of people.\n\nDespite the concerns over the security situation in Rakhine, China’s position is that Myanmar is ready to take back the refugees.\n\nIt is also advocating resolving the issue through bilateral talks between Myanmar and Bangladesh, and minimizing the role of parties like the United Nations, which runs the refugee camps, officials from both Myanmar and Bangladeshi told Reuters.\n\nChina has presented its diplomatic work in Myanmar and Bangladesh as humanitarian, but analysts and diplomats in Yangon say those efforts have broader geopolitical aims.\n\n“I’d say that China is not involved in the Rohingya crisis for humanitarian reasons, but for political and economic considerations,” said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington.\n\n“China would like to be the new peacemaker in the region,” she said, adding that China wanted to show how its approach to resolving the crisis could succeed where Western powers had failed. “It’s a competition for leadership.”\n\nNowkhim, a refugee leader in Kutapalong, one of the camps in Bangladesh, said the general perception among the Rohingya was that China was merely pressing Myanmar’s official line and was unwilling to push it to accept their demands.\n\nA video from a meeting between refugee leaders and Chinese diplomats, which was seen by Reuters, shows a Chinese official saying that the Rohingya should drop demands such as the right to be recognized as an ethnic group in Myanmar.\n\nMyanmar’s position is that the Rohingya are Muslim migrants from the Indian sub-continent and not one of the country’s ethnic groups – which would technically grant them citizenship.\n\n“They are not willing to solve our problem easily,” said Nowkhim. “They are just showing the world that ‘we meet with Rohingya’.”\n\nFAILED EFFORTS\n\nBeijing’s last major effort to kickstart repatriation was in August after Myanmar compiled a list of 3,000 Rohingya approved for return. But that effort failed after hundreds of the refugees on the list went into hiding to avoid being sent back.\n\nStanding in one of the refugee camps in Bangladesh at the time, a Chinese diplomat said that someone needed to make the first move to send the Rohingya back.\n\nMyanmar officials waited on the other side of the border, but not a single refugee volunteered to return. Only about 400 refugees have since returned separately, according to Myanmar authorities. Rohingya leaders say that most of returnees are those with close ties to the Myanmar government.\n\nMyanmar has also rebuffed some of China’s efforts, last year rejecting a proposal that refugees be allowed to visit Rakhine to assess conditions.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nA local businessman tasked with assembling the donated containers, who asked not to be named, said he saw little point in continuing with his work.\n\n“People haven’t stayed in the houses for two years,” he said. “I will stop building this year,” he added.\n\n“The situation has not changed, right?”",

                        "docText": "NEW DELHI: India continues to remain in fray to play a role in the strategically located Colombo Port in the Indian Ocean Region, notwithstanding the Sri Lanka’s decision to drop plans to privatise the port’s East Container Terminal ( ECT ).In a statement last week, Sri Lankan minister for ports and shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe said the construction of the terminal was being expedited by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), a state-run agency in the island nation. The ECT will be operated by the SLPA \"to ensure best services for all mega container vessels calling at the Port of Colombo in near future”, the minister said.President Maithripala Sirisena’s government seems to have come under pressure to scrap the plan due to fear that the port’s privatisation could cost a large number of jobs. SLPA was also against privatisation citing this reason, people familiar with the matter told ET.An India-led consortium, was frontrunner for the ECT project, was earlier intimated of the domestic sensitivities arising out of the decision to privatise the project.But the Indian consortium would still likely play some role in the project but the details of that have not yet been decided, a person familiar with the matter said.SLPA claimed that it had resources to handle the ECT expansion project, since China Merchants Port Holding has now taken over running of the lossmaking Hambantota Port. The ECT project involves running of an existing 400-metre deep-water berth, as well its expansion to 1,200 metres, including design, finance, construction, operation and maintenance.Colombo wanted a foreign country to partner with SLPA to invest and take over the ECT, and India showed interest in the project.As much as 75% of trans-shipment from the Colombo port goes to India and Delhi is looking at getting a stake there in the heart of the Indian Ocean Region. Besides Colombo, in eastern part of Sri Lanka, India and Japan would jointly develop the Trincomalee port.State-run Container Corporation of India formed a consortium with APM Terminals BV, John Keells Holdings and Maersk Line to bid for the Colombo port’s ECT. The total project value was expected to be $550-600 million. The south terminal of the port is already owned and operated by China Merchants Port. Colombo Port is the busiest in Sri Lanka and ranks among the top 35 in the world.Meanwhile, Indian think tank Gateway House in a report on Beijing’s footprint in South Asia said China had invested or committed to invest more than $150 billion in the economies of Bangladesh, the Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. China is now the largest overseas investor in the Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, it said.Chinese penetration is the highest in Myanmar and Pakistan, where Chinese money is bolstering governments that face international isolation due to human rights violations and terrorism, respectively, the report said. But Bangladesh, the most vibrant economy in India’s neighbourhood, is least dependent on China.“China’s playbook is clear: It first enters as a military supplier, then cultivates and partners with local elites, provides modern infrastructure with deferred payments, and entrenches itself,” the recently published report said. “Beyond hard infrastructure, China is thinking geo-economics. It is investing in the financial systems of these countries. Beijing has taken stakes in the Dhaka and Karachi stock exchanges and cultivated a yuan trade between China and Pakistan. It is establishing China-based courts for arbitration of BRI disputes. Clearly, Beijing seeks to create new rules, governing business and financial systems in the region — changes that could cement its dominance in India’s neighbourhood,” it said.",

                        "docText": "(CNN) When Sri Lanka's government first looked to develop a port on its southern coast that faced the Indian Ocean, it went not to China, but to its neighbor, India.\n\nThen-Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said he urgently needed funding to transform the harbor of his home town and asked Indian officials for help with the project.\n\nNew Delhi showed little interest in funding a costly and massive port construction project in the underdeveloped fishing village of Hambantota, a district that had been crushed by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004\n\n\"It was offered to India first. I was desperate for development work, but ultimately the Chinese agreed to build it,\" Rajapaksa said in an interview with Singapore's Straits Times in 2010\n\nThe venture was considered economically unviable and indeed, in the years that followed, the port sat empty and neglected, and Sri Lanka's debt ballooned\n\nBut India's economic foresight might have cost it in terms of strategic geopolitics, since the debt incurred on the port and the surrounding infrastructure undertakings now belong to its great rival.\n\nChina's official licensing of the port in December last year gives it yet another point of access over a key shipping route, and the prospect of providing it with a sizeable presence in India's immediate backyard and traditional sphere of influence, bringing China closer to India's shores than New Delhi might like.\n\nSri Lankan dancers perform at the site of the Hambantota port during a ceremony marking the first phase of construction, August 15, 2010.\n\nMoreover, Sri Lanka's decision to sign a 99-year lease with a Chinese state-owned company for the Hambantota port to service some of the billions it owes to Beijing has some observers concerned other developing nations doing business with China as part of China's One Belt One Road initiative might fall into similar financial straits.\n\nA trap, they warn, that may well have them owing more than just money to Beijing.\n\n\"China is, in many cases, the only party with the interest and the capital to deliver on these projects,\" said Jeff Smith, a research fellow on South Asia at the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC. \"The relevant question for everyone is: at what cost?\"\n\n'A determined strategy by China'\n\nChina has for decades invested in Sri Lanka, particularly during moments in recent history when much of the international community held off\n\nJeff Smith points out that along with the Hambantota port investments, Beijing loaned Sri Lanka $200 million in 2010 for a second international airport and a year later a further $810 million for the \"second phase of the port project.\"\n\nThere was more. $272 million for a railway in 2013 and more than $1 billion for the Colombo Port City project, ventures that hired mostly Chinese workers (one Sri Lankan report put the number of Chinese workers dedicated to projects in 2009 at 25,000 ), and all with money Sri Lanka could barely afford to repay.\n\nAfter an equity swap, an IMF bailout and more control over the projects ceded to Beijing, the terms of the debt were restructured, giving Sri Lanka some breathing space.\n\nIn 2017, however, the Hambantota port proved too costly for Sri Lanka to sustain.\n\n\"They (the Chinese) called in the debt, and the debt has been paid by Sri Lanka giving them the (Hambantota) port. That port then gives them not only a strategic access point into India's sphere of influence through which China can deploy its naval forces, but it also gives China an advantageous position to export its goods into India's economic sphere, so it's achieved a number of strategic aims in that regard,\" said Malcolm Davis, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Sydney.\n\n\"This is part of a determined strategy by China to extend its influence across the Indian Ocean at the expense of India and it's using Sri Lanka to achieve it,\" he said.\n\nDetails of the new agreement between China and Sri Lanka have not been made public.\n\nThe port is an \"important project aimed at spurring local economic growth based on equality and mutual benefits,\" according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It declined to answer further when asked by reporters.\n\nConstruction workers operate heavy equipment at the base of Sri Lanka's Hambantota port August 1, 2010. Some 350 Chinese staff helped in the first phase of construction.\n\n'Creating demand for Chinese goods'\n\nChina's claiming of controlling stakes in strategic ports along critical shipping lanes -- what analysts have taken to referring to as its \"string of pearls\" -- beginning at the Straits of Malacca and dotting the Indian Ocean, should signal Beijing's ultimate ambitions, said Davis.\n\n\"There's a bigger picture here, that the more you invest in the Belt and Road initiative, the more the Chinese are in a position to force your country to align politically in terms of policy,\" Davis told CNN.\n\n\"So you become dependent on their investment and their largesse, and you're less likely to be critical of them and you're more likely to accommodate their interests strategically.\"\n\nBeijing's other potential partners are finding difficulty with some of their own joint projects.\n\nIn Myanmar, a $3.6 billion dam project has stalled. The then-military backed government suspended work on the Myitsone dam in the north of the country in 2011, with talks regarding its future ongoing.\n\nPakistan withdrew from a $14 billion agreement with China for a dam last November because the conditions of the deal included China taking ownership of the project and were \"not doable and against our interests,\" Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority chairman Muzammil Hussain was quoted as saying. Like Nepal, Pakistan has since indicated it would also look to shoulder the cost of the dam rather than go to an outside investor.\n\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed to be unaware of this when asked about the situation by reporters in Beijing in December. The country's top economic planning agency later said that the two countries were discussing cooperating on the dam project but that there'd been no discussion of proposals to move it forward. The agency said \"Pakistan media's reporting on this project has been inaccurate, or only represented the views of certain officials.\"\n\nBut China is still spending in Pakistan. It is building a hydroelectric power station in the Rawalpindi district, and it is developing the port of Gwadar , strategically located on the Arabian Sea.\n\nChina's trade deal with the Maldives government included investments in developing the international airport and a bridge, but the Maldives in return has taken on a significant number of controversial loan obligations.\n\nLast July, former President Mohamed Nasheed said the loan interest the traditionally Indian ally pays to service its foreign debt to China is more than 20% of the country's budget. He said that part of the deal included China's receipt of 16 \"strategically located islands\" in navigation sea-lanes.\n\nA Sri Lankan soldier walks past a billboard bearing portraits of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse, ahead's of Xi's visit to the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, September 15, 2014.\n\nDean Cheng, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, said that the initial wave of Chinese investments in the Indian Ocean, the so-called string of pearls, was largely driven by economic considerations. The investments, he said, \"would facilitate economic growth, which would benefit Chinese companies. Moreover, the construction projects would entail Chinese workers (a feature of most Chinese projects abroad, bringing their own work force), and create a demand base for Chinese goods.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said the Chinese are clearly intent on creating a friendly political network of states. \"There's nothing inherently dangerous about political considerations in economic investments,\" he told CNN. \"It would be foolish to think that any state is wholly driven by economic considerations.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Leaders attend China's Belt and Road Forum Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Leaders attend China's Belt and Road Forum 01:43\n\nWhither India?\n\nThe ever-encroaching Chinese presence into India's sphere of political and economic influence has been noted, but so far, says Manoj Joshi, New Delhi purports to be unruffled, as long as Hambantota remains a commercial port, and no Chinese naval vessels suddenly appear in the vicinity.\n\n\"In 2014 a Chinese submarine was spotted in Colombo harbor and that was the first time we saw that and the Indian side was a bit concerned,\" said Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. At the time Indian defense officials expressed \"serious concern\" to their Sri Lankan counterpart , and naval chiefs from both countries met to discuss the incidents. Then-Defense Minister Arun Jaitley said the government \"keeps a constant watch on all developments concerning our national security and economic interests and takes necessary measures to safeguard them.\"\n\nA Sri Lankan commando stands guard on the Hambantota construction site, November 18, 2010.\n\n\"It's geopolitical competition and India sees itself as the foremost nation in Asia and with the Chinese building a port, building and airport, building roads in Sri Lanka, they've emerged as big investors there and the Indians are obviously feeling somewhat nervous because India doesn't have those kind of resources to compete with,\" Joshi told CNN.\n\n\"What we worry about is, we already have a border problem with China and now that competition goes to the Indian Ocean region. That could be against our interests.\"\n\nIndia and China share a 2,500 mile-long border, and have regularly faced off over perceived intrusions on each other's terrain as well as activity in uninhabited territory claimed by China and Bhutan, an Indian ally.\n\n\"Everybody talks about China and India being major rivals, I think China doesn't see India as a genuine long-term rival, I think it looks at India and sees a classic case of democracy gone wrong,\" said Yvonne Chiu, assistant professor in the politics department at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nIndia is incredibly corrupt , its infrastructure is terrible, and it is riddled with religious and demographic problems,\" she told CNN. \"Except it is very large. It does have a big population as well and it's on the border. So it's a regional rival, but I don't think they take India seriously as a global rival.\"\n\nSri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapakse, center, flanked by his eldest son and parliamentarian Namal Rajapakse, right, and Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne, left, tour the Hambantota construction site, November 18, 2010.\n\nFor its part, India is now taking an active interest in Hambantota. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reported to be in talks with Sri Lanka about taking over the airport near the port, which was built using Chinese funds that Beijing itself wants to manage and is pushing for control with the Sri Lankan government. During a media briefing last November, Raveesh Kumar, an official spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, would only say that New Delhi has \"a lot of developmental projects\" going on in Sri Lanka and declined to elaborate further. Colombo has yet to make a decision involving the airport.\n\nAnd New Delhi continues to actively participate in large-scale naval exercises in regional waters alongside allies Japan, and the US, and into the future, possibly Australia too, all to Beijing's continued consternation.\n\nLast year's Malabar exercises in the Bay of Bengal involving the US, Japan and India were the largest the region has seen in more than two decades\n\n\"India, of course, remains highly influential in Sri Lanka, and would not look kindly on any effort to pressure the government on matters related to defense and national security,\" said Jeff Smith. \"Nor would the Sri Lankan military, which values its exchanges with the US .\"\n\nModi will be in Singapore in June, attending the Shangri-La dialogue , an annual meeting of defense ministers, military chiefs and defense officials from the Asia-Pacific. His keynote address will be carefully watched for words on China's maritime expansion.\n\nA White House unable to compete with China\n\nSouth Asia's problems are not on Washington's radar right now, says Hong Kong University professor Chiu. The White House has much of its focus -- along with a substantial naval presence -- directed towards the Korean Peninsula and the ongoing crisis there. And while the US is distracted, China is slowly and incrementally changing the seascape in the Asia Pacific. China claims disputed islands in the South China Sea as part of its territory and has been militarizing some of those islands, reclaiming land on others and turning sandbars into islands to assert sovereignty over the area.\n\n\"Everything that they do, like building these islands (in the South China Sea) and stuff that is illegal internationally , but nobody wants to get into a conflict over, it adds up and you have a new status quo and it's too late to do anything about it,\" Chiu said.\n\n\"China can't afford to go to war over anything ... it would most likely lose against a major power ... but these kind of small incremental things, people will let them get away with. As long as they're patient, it could have the same effect as going to war.\"\n\nEven as China has taken the long view, Dean Cheng argues it's never too late for the US and its allies to do something to counter Beijing's ambitions.\n\n\"The US, in cooperation with India, Japan and possibly the European Union, could offer alternative financing,\" Cheng said. \"They could help train local officials, lawyers, etc, to become better negotiators. They can push for transparency, especially in Chinese-sponsored institutions to make clear the terms of the loans, payback processes, as well as how contracts are rewarded.\"\n\nSri Lankan police stand guard during a protest in Colombo against the lease of the loss-making Hambantota port to China, February 1, 2017.\n\nLast October US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson gave a speech on the US relationship with India . Tillerson said it was up to New Delhi and Washington to \"do a better job leveraging our collective expertise to meet common challenges while seeking even more avenues of cooperation.\"\n\n\"We must also recognize that many Indo-Pacific nations have limited alternatives when it comes to infrastructure investment programs and financing schemes, which often fail to promote jobs or prosperity for the people they claim to help,\" Tillerson said. \"It's time to expand transparent, high-standard regional lending mechanisms, tools that will actually help nations instead of saddle them with mounting debt.\"\n\nTillerson told reporters that during the East Asia ministerial summit in August that the US had started \"a quiet conversation with others about what they were experiencing , what they need.\"\n\nHowever, he also admitted Washington's constraints. \"We will not be able to compete with the kind of terms that China offers,\" said Tillerson. \"But countries have to decide, what are they willing to pay to secure their sovereignty and their future control of their economies? And we've had those discussions with them as well.\"\n\nChina's resources are nowhere near as limited as the US and its allies, says Yvonne Chiu from the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\"Right now, it can play on multiple fronts at once,\" Chiu notes. \"And they take a very long view. If you're a power like the US, you're really far away. That distance is going to limit how much attention you can pay to the region. The US has to pick and choose and it's chosen East Asia. So, unless something really major happens, that's probably where their attention is going to stay.\"\n\nA Chinese worker at the construction site of a Chinese-funded $1.4 billion reclamation project in Colombo, Sri Lanka in October 2017.\n\nAs 2017 wrapped up, the Chinese state news agency Xinhua published a dispatch from Colombo, describing how the Hambantota port was \"now racing along a developmental fast-track.\n\nChinese and Sri Lankan workers were building a highway north of the port, along with a bridge, and the Chinese Harbor Engineering Company is negotiating with the Sri Lankan government to develop a Logistics Zone that will include a natural gas power plant and refineries, the agency reported.\n\nOn the first day of the new year, the Chinese flag flew beside Sri Lanka's at the port for the first time ever.\n\nRather than resist getting into further debt, Sri Lanka's government appears to be making more deals with China that it will may yet struggle to pay back.",

                        "docText": "China is building a 21st century empire — one where trade and debt lead the way, not armadas and armies.\n\nIf President Xi Jinping's ambitions become a reality, Beijing will cement its position at the centre of a new world economic order spanning more than half the globe.\n\nThe most tangible sign of Xi's designs is the new Silk Road he proposed in 2013. That became the \"Belt and Road\" initiative, a mix of foreign policy, economic strategy and charm offensive, all nurtured by a torrent of Chinese money.\n\nXi calls it \"a road for peace\". Other world powers such as Japan and the US remain sceptical about its stated aims and even more worried about unspoken ones, especially those hinting at military expansion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo check the reality of Belt and Road from the ground up, Bloomberg reporters visited five cities on three continents at the forefront of China's grand plan.\n\nWhat emerges is a picture of mostly poor nations that jumped at the promise of Chinese-financed projects.\n\nChina has already outspent the post-World War II US Marshall Plan, measured in today's dollars. Within a decade, Morgan Stanley estimates, China and its local partners will spend as much as US$1.3 trillion ($1.98t) on railways, roads, ports and power grids.\n\n\"It's not for today. It's for mid-21st century China,\" says Nadege Rolland, Washington-based senior fellow for political and security affairs at the National Bureau of Asian Research.\n\nMost of the proposed plans are infrastructure-based, such as a new deep-sea port in Myanmar and power lines in the Maldives.\n\nBut almost any overseas investment gets tagged as being part of the initiative: a train carrying Chinese sunflower seeds to Tehran, a new courthouse in Papua New Guinea, an irrigation system in the Philippines.\n\nThe growing web of trade routes, including the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road Initiative, now extends into at least 76 countries, mostly developing nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, plus a handful of countries on the eastern edge of Europe.\n\nChina's plans to build or rebuild dozens of seaports have sounded alarm bells in Washington and New Delhi: how many of those docks will end up hosting Chinese warships?\n\nChina has said it has no intention of using Belt and Road to exert undue political or military influence and that the initiative is designed only to enhance economic and cultural understanding between nations.\n\nIf that's the case, Xi will need to persuade the people who live along the length and breadth of his new Silk Road.\n\nYiwu, China\n\nNestled in the mountains of Zhejiang province, Yiwu is a marketplace like no other. A vast complex of five-storey buildings houses 75,000 booths selling 1.8 million kinds of goods across an expanse the size of 650 soccer fields.\n\nMost of the thousands upon thousands of stalls specialise in single items — scissors, for example: scores and scores of different kinds of scissors.\n\nA city of 1.2 million people, Yiwu got a big boost from Belt and Road. People from Beirut to Seoul and beyond have come to start businesses. Some 13,000 traders from around the world now live here.\n\nBack in 2013, Yiwu's vast halls were almost deserted. Wholesalers and producers struggled with soaring manufacturing costs and the rise of online marketplaces.\n\nThen came the railway. The first Europe-bound train pulled out of here in November 2014, heading to Kazakhstan and Russia, then through eastern Europe and on to Madrid — an 12,870km journey.\n\nMore routes have since opened to destinations including London, Amsterdam and Tehran.\n\nTrains have cut the time to Europe by a third or more compared with ships. The return journeys bring European goods such as wine, olive oil and vitamin pills.\n\nRail freight accounts for less than 1 per cent of China's overall exports, is more expensive than seaborne trade and slower and less flexible than air cargo. But for cities such as Yiwu, and especially for those in western China even farther away from seaports, the train that Xi built has injected new life into their economies.\n\nHambantota, Sri Lanka\n\nIn a southern Sri Lankan jungle, Dharmasena Hettiarchchi plucks green chilli peppers. His grandfather tended the same patch of land when this island was the British colony of Ceylon.\n\nHettiarchchi says, \"if a jeep with Chinese characters comes down the road, the whole village will gather in protest.\"\n\nHettiarchchi's village and the surrounding town of Hambantota have become a cautionary tale for Xi's Belt and Road aspirations. The idea was to take a quiet harbour visited by less than one ship a month and turn it into a modern, bustling seaport. It hasn't turned out so well.\n\nAfter Sri Lanka elected Mahinda Rajapaksa as President in 2005, he began sprinkling development projects across the region. Long before Belt and Road was officially Chinese Government policy, Beijing was eager to lend a hand with loans.\n\nHambantota (population at the time 11,200) got a new port, international conference centre, cricket stadium and an airport that, despite all the staff on show, doesn't service a single scheduled flight.\n\nMaking anti- elephant fences in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. Photo / Bloomberg\n\nTo fund the projects, Sri Lanka's Government fell deep into debt. By the time Rajapaksa was voted out of office in 2015, more than 90 per cent of Government revenue was going towards servicing debt.\n\nLast year, a new Sri Lankan Government basically handed the seaport over to China in return for US$1.1b. Under a 99-year lease, the Government gave 70 per cent ownership of the port to China Merchants Group, a state-owned company.\n\nChina Merchants has promised to turn the port into a major regional trading hub. But some local people have had enough of promises.\n\n\"All these huge projects are a waste,\" says Sisira Kumara Wahalathanthri, a local politician who opposes the current Sri Lanka Government. \"No ships are coming to the port. No flights are coming to the airport.\"\n\nAt an ancient Buddhist temple, head monk Beragama Wimala Buddhi Thero says the area is \"becoming a Chinese colony\".\n\nChilli farmer Hettiarchchi is wary of the surveyors who've begun to appear in his neighbourhood.\n\nHe says the plan is for him to be relocated to make way for development.\n\nBut what Hettiarchchi could be losing can't be replaced easily or quickly.\n\nGesturing to a towering teak tree, the 52-year-old says, \"a tree like this cannot grow within my lifetime\".\n\nGwadar, Pakistan\n\nSurrounded by desert in southwest Pakistan there's a stone arch bearing a single name, Al-Noor. Farther along a desolate road, a black shipping container has been painted to tell you where you are: Gwadar Creek Arena.\n\nAl-Noor and Gwadar Creek are planned housing developments — emphasis on \"planned\". There's nothing here yet. The same goes for White Pearl City, Canadian City, Sun Silver City and other residential tracts on the drawing boards.\n\nWhat you see are lots of billboards, as speculators and developers carve out future projects on the sun-blasted outskirts of an old fishing village named Gwadar.\n\nGwadar is a city of dreams made in China. Beijing is pouring money into highways and roads, a hospital, a coal-fired power plant, a new airport, a special economic zone along the lines of Shenzhen and, crucially, the port.\n\nA redevelopment project was begun in the 2000s, under then-military ruler Pervez Musharraf, but it foundered. In 2013 the Chinese arrived. Beijing is financing the lion's share of the US$1b in spending on the port and infrastructure elsewhere in the area.\n\nGwadar is so remote that its electricity comes from Iran, 100km down the coast. In recent years, the village has become a city of 100,000 or so, although it is still mostly a gigantic building site.\n\nIt's hard to imagine Gwadar as the sea terminus of a road-and-rail trade link stretching 4800km to eastern China. Most of the route would traverse some of the world's most inhospitable — and economically barren — mountains and deserts.\n\nA sign welcomes the Chinese at Gwadar, in Pakistan. Photo / Bloomberg\n\nSome say that military expansion is the real driver of the activity in and around Gwadar.\n\nZahid Ali sees things very differently. Desperate to find a way to pay off his debts, he asked a client if there was any job in Pakistan that paid 50,000 rupees ($615) a month. Go to Gwadar, the customer replied.\n\nThat's what Ali did. He started as a labourer, learned steel work and was soon earning 55,000 rupees a month. Now, having learned a little Chinese, he's been promoted to supervisor.\n\n\"It's good that the Chinese came here,\" he says. \"A lot of people have gotten jobs who were jobless.\"\n\nOne of the first things a visitor to Gwadar notes is that there are more soldiers on the streets than police — an added precaution against the threat of terrorism across Pakistan.\n\nSecurity is tight because Chinese wouldn't come otherwise, says a Pakistani army officer who declined to be named because he's not authorised to talk to the news media.\n\nGood, says Naseem Ahmed, 25, who works for the provincial government. \"Security is great here. You can be out at 3am in the morning, and there is no fear.\"\n\nMombasa, Kenya\n\nAstride his boda boda, or motorcycle taxi, in Mombasa, Simon Agina is counting containers on a passing train heading to Nairobi: \"... 82, 83, 84.\"\n\nThere are plenty of containers back where those came from — and much more besides.\n\nThe port of Mombasa, Kenya's import lifeline, is a heaving mass of traffic of all sorts.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, with the ancient British colonial-era Mombasa-to-Nairobi narrow-gauge railway falling into disrepair and Beijing in the market for African investments, Kenya made its move. It agreed to let China finance and build a standard-gauge railway at a cost of US$3.8b.\n\nAtanas Maina, managing director of Kenya Railways, says more than 30,000 Kenyans were employed directly on the project, run by China Road and Bridge; an additional 8000 worked for subcontractors.\n\nThe first paying passengers rode the 470km line in June last year.\n\nLike any major infrastructure project, the rail line has its detractors. The economist and Government critic David Ndii says it's not commercially viable, while a Kenyan newspaper, the Standard, accused China Road and Bridge of \"neo-colonialism, racism and blatant discrimination\" in its treatment of local employees.\n\nThe train that pulls out of Nairobi Railway Station each morning at 8am, with noteworthy punctuality, is called the Madaraka Express. In Swahili, \"madaraka\" means power or responsibility; Madaraka Day, a national holiday, celebrates self-rule.\n\nChina financed 90 per cent of the railway's cost. And the giant Chinese Communications Construction will operate it for its first decade.\n\nThe area around the station thrums with activity as construction pushes ahead on houses, container yards and warehouses.\n\nAlong the route to Mombasa, gleaming steel-and-glass stations stand out against clusters of tiny houses with rusty corrugated iron roofs and mud walls.\n\nThe new track, the trains, the stations — \"you don't see that kind of infrastructure development in this part of the country,\" says Agina, the boda boda driver. \"This is amazing.\"\n\nPiraeus, Greece\n\nIt was 2016. Greece was in the vice-grip of the European sovereign debt crisis. Its neighbours and creditors were pressuring the Government to enforce austerity. So Greece sold control of the Piraeus seaport to China Cosco Shipping, a Chinese state-owned enterprise.\n\nThe deal began years before the Belt and Road project was announced — in 2009, Cosco won a contract to run part of Piraeus' container business — and was then folded into the initiative.\n\nThe port deal marked China's gradual takeover of one of Europe's oldest and most important sea gateways. Piraeus has been Athens' port and shipyard for about 2500 years.\n\nFrom his office, Ioannis Kordatos, managing director of the Hellenic Welding Association, can see the wall of containers stacked high at Pier II, Cosco's original beachhead here.\n\n\"If Cosco magically disappeared tomorrow, it would be a huge loss,\" says Kordatos.\n\n\"What matters isn't that they are Chinese, but that they are a private company doing serious business in the area.\"\n\nVery serious business.\n\nThe 2016 deal gave Cosco a 67 per cent share of Piraeus Port Authority for €368.5m.\n\nSince Cosco became involved, Piraeus has risen to be Europe's seventh-busiest container port; 10 years ago, it wasn't in Europe's top 15.\n\nCosco plans to upgrade the ferry and cruise ship terminals, adding a shopping mall and new hotels. Farther away, Cosco's investments could help revive Greece's rust-belt industrial heartland.\n\nA planned logistics centre, linked to the port by rail, could become a staging area for goods headed north through the Balkans.\n\nGiorgos Gogos, general secretary of the Piraeus Dockworkers Union, says he's worried about the impact of a Chinese state-owned enterprise on labour relations and the local community.\n\n\"We think it's a mistake for infrastructure like this to leave the state,\" he says.\n\n\"The Chinese have their own way of operating.\"\n\nFor all the concern about the potentially corrosive effects on Greece's economy and sovereignty — and about Beijing's ulterior motives — Cosco's incursion into Piraeus has something in common with Beijing's other investments along the vast Belt and Road: China put its money where others wouldn't.\n\n— Bloomberg",

Fazry Ismail/Pool via REUTERS\n\nSpeaking in the Papua New Guinean capital, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said there would be no end to American tariffs until China changed its ways, after its president, Xi Jinping, warned that the shadow of protectionism and unilateralism was hanging over global growth.\n\nIllustrating the impasse between the world’s two largest economies, a diplomat involved in negotiating an APEC leaders’ declaration told Reuters trade was a sticking point, and the host nation was having trouble finding language acceptable to all.\n\nPence took direct aim at Xi’s flagship Belt and Road program, which China has been promoting to Pacific nations at APEC, saying countries should not accept debt that compromised their sovereignty.\n\n“We do not offer constricting belt or a one-way road,” Pence told the APEC CEO summit, a precursor to the official leaders’ meeting, held on a cruise liner tethered in Port Moresby’s Fairfax Harbour.\n\nChina’s efforts to win friends in the resource-rich Pacific have been watched warily by the traditionally influential powers in the region - Australia and the United States.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is not attending the APEC meeting, nor is his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.\n\nXi, who is staying in Port Moresby, has been feted by PNG officials and stoked Western concern on Friday when he held a meeting with Pacific island leaders, in which he pitched the Belt and Road initiative.\n\nSpeaking before Pence, Xi said there was no geopolitical agenda behind the project, which was unveiled in 2013 and aims to bolster a network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.\n\n“It does not exclude anyone. It is not an exclusive club closed to non-members, nor is it a trap as some people have labeled it.”\n\nThere have been concerns that small countries that sign up for infrastructure projects will be left with debt burdens they cannot service, something Pence highlighted.\n\n“Do not accept foreign debt that could compromise your sovereignty. Protect your interest. Preserve your independence. And just like America, always put your country first,” he said.\n\nSri Lanka formally handed over commercial activities in its main southern port of Hambantota to a Chinese company last December as part of a plan to convert $6 billion of loans that Sri Lanka owed China into equity.\n\nSoon after Pence spoke, Australia said it was joining the United States and Japan in a partnership that would help countries in the region develop infrastructure priorities, a possible alternative to China’s Belt and Road.\n\nREGIONAL SECURITY\n\nPence also said the United States would join Australia to help Papua New Guinea build a navy base on its Manus Island, which was a U.S. base in World War Two.\n\nThe plan comes after China emerged as a possible developer of the deep-water port, which analysts say could impact the West’s ability to navigate in the Pacific while offering China a site close to U.S. bases in Guam.\n\n“The United States of America will continue to uphold the freedom of the seas and the skies, which are so essential to our prosperity,” Pence said.\n\nIn a meeting that could irritate Beijing, Pence had talks with Taiwan’s envoy to APEC, Morris Chang.\n\nBeijing considers Taiwan a wayward province of “one China”, ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.\n\nDespite Taiwan’s lack of diplomatic recognition by the majority of countries, APEC allows it to participate as an economic, rather than political, entity.\n\nPence later told reporters traveling with him he would “carry back” a Taiwan proposal for a free trade agreement.\n\nDOUBLE TARIFFS?\n\nThere were differences between other APEC members, with some calling for radical change to trade systems while others argued for a return to the status quo on globalization.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad warned globalization was leaving some people behind and fuelling inequality.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison mounted a defense of free trade, saying a billion people had been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1991 because of the jobs and cheaper goods that free trade brought.\n\nXi told delegates that the shadow of “protectionism and unilateralism” hung over global growth and erecting barriers and cutting ties was short-sighted and doomed to fail.\n\nBut Pence made it clear that the United States would not back down, saying it could more than double the $250 billion of Chinese goods subject to tariffs.\n\n“The United States though will not change course until China changes its ways,” Pence said.\n\nTrump and Xi are due to meet at a G20 meeting in Argentina late this month, raising some hope that trade tension could ease.\n\nTrump is pressing China to reduce its huge bilateral trade surplus and make sweeping changes to its policies on trade, technology transfers and high-tech industrial subsidies.\n\nChina has denied that U.S. companies are forced to transfer technology and sees U.S. demands on rolling back its industrial policies as an attempt to contain China’s economic rise.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nSebastián Piñera, the president of Chile, which will host next year’s APEC, called on the two powers to find a resolution.\n\n“This is a very good opportunity to ask the U.S. and China to find ways to end their tariff and trade war which benefits no one,” he told the forum.\n\n“Both countries will have to change course.”",

On a recent afternoon, the barely used highway built with Chinese money through a rural stretch of the island nation carried more 50-kilogram (110-pound) rice sacks than vehicles. \"The road gets really hot, so the rice dries faster,\" Gamage said.The project is one of several in Sri Lanka that offer lessons for countries looking to snag some of the more than $500 billion projected to underpin Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Interviews with the nation’s politicians, government officials and financial experts show that mitigating the risks is key to maximizing opportunities.When a 25-year civil war ended in 2009, Sri Lanka had little choice but to turn to China. Beijing stepped up aid and arms shipments as the U.S. and Europe withdrew funding, leaving China in position to quickly offer loans and financing.Many countries in South Asia are in a similar position. Myanmar and Iran were under western sanctions, while extremist violence has kept investors away from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.“No one was interested in investing in Sri Lanka,” said Luxman Siriwardena, a former finance ministry official who is now executive director of Colombo’s Pathfinder Foundation, a research group. “Anything is great when there is no alternative.”Even so, Sri Lanka’s experience came with some costly lessons.The lure of easy money can tempt politicians to approve expensive projects that generate little economic activity. The sleepy southern district of Hambantota -- home to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa -- is a case in point.Aside from the empty four-lane highway, Hambantota boasts an international airport that services one scheduled flight a day, a conference center that is hardly used and a port that handles one ship a day. All were goodies approved by Rajapaksa to benefit his electoral constituency in one of the country’s least developed regions.The country now spends 80 percent of government revenues paying down what Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has called \"unprecedented\" debts . Last year, Wickremesinghe -- who took office after Rajapaksa lost the presidency -- sold the port to a Chinese firm for $1.1 billion to ease the debt burden.\"If other countries are getting investments, they should not do it the way that we are doing it in Sri Lanka,\" said Beragama Wimala Buddhi Thero, the head monk at a local Buddhist temple who worries the new projects will displace villagers. \"They should do it in a controlled way. And it should be transparent to the common people.\"In the 2015 election, Rajapaksa suffered a surprise defeat after challenger Maithripala Sirisena attacked his tight relations with China, warning that Sri Lankans “would become slaves” if the trend continued. Three years later, Rajapaksa’s political group is attacking Sirisena for close ties with China.\"The Chinese are like an octopus -- once they get a hold of something, they take everything,\" said Ruwan Kumara, a local politician aligned with Rajapaksa who runs a store in Hambantota. \"They want to get a hold of all the smaller Asian countries and become the most powerful country in Asia.\"While discontent brews in the countryside, many in the capital benefit from the Chinese cash. Cranes loomed over the skyline in Sri Lanka’s capital, where a $1.4 billion land reclamation project led by state-owned China Communications Construction’s China Harbor Engineering aims to transform Colombo into a \"world class\" South Asian hub.\"Sri Lanka is smack in the middle\" of China’s global infrastructure plans, said Thulci Aluwihare, who left Pricewaterhousecoopers LLP to join the Chinese firm’s local subsidiary. \"As a nation, we should take advantage of this capital being exported out of China for infrastructure development. And make use of it.\"China has said its Belt-and-Road Initiative is a win-win solution that allows it to develop trade routes and export excess capital while building much-needed infrastructure in emerging economies. Yet that hasn’t stopped countries like India -- Sri Lanka’s second-largest trading partner -- from fearing a potential military component, particularly in Hambantota port.\"Clearly, those of us in the region need to be sensitive to India’s geopolitical interests,\" Sri Lankan central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said in late March at a forum in Colombo. \"We in Sri Lanka have learnt the hard way that there are some red lines.\"The prime minister said in a March 26 interview that he’s seeking more foreign inflows from India and Japan amid criticisms of Chinese investment. But in Colombo, others welcome the geopolitical political shift.With the Asian Development Bank estimating the region needs $1.7 trillion in infrastructure spending annually, Beijing’s spending spree looks like a version of the Marshall Plan, according to Siriwardena, the former Sri Lanka finance ministry official.“The Marshall Plan was brought in when the Americans wanted to resurrect or reconstruct Europe, but they didn’t do it for nothing -- they created a market for themselves, they developed allies,” he said. “We have something like that now.”",

Asian and African leaders plan to press Beijing at a conference starting Thursday, April 24, 2019, to reduce the politically volatile debt burden left by its Belt and Road Initiative to build ports and other trade-related infrastructure. (Khalil Senosi, File/Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING — Asian and African leaders plan to press Beijing at a conference this week to reduce the politically volatile debt burden left by its Belt and Road Initiative to build ports and other trade-related infrastructure.\n\nThat may bring a note of conflict to official celebration of President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign initiative, which has stirred anxiety in Washington, Moscow and Tokyo about Beijing’s strategic ambitions. The meeting starting Thursday brings together leaders or envoys from three dozen countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Serbia, Myanmar and Kenya.\n\nDebt “is going to be part of the prime minister’s focus at the forum,” said Billenne Seyoum, press secretary for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia.\n\nIn a meeting Wednesday, Xi told Abiy that Beijing had forgiven interest due on loans owed by Ethiopia through the end of 2018, the prime minister’s office announced on its Facebook page. It gave no financial details.\n\nOther governments welcomed Beijing’s initiative in a region the Asian Development Bank says needs $26 trillion of investment by 2030 to keep economies growing. But countries including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have canceled or renegotiated railways and other projects they concluded were too expensive or unproductive.\n\nMost projects are built by Chinese state-owned companies and financed with loans from government banks at commercial interest rates that critics say could leave borrowers mired in debt they cannot repay.\n\nBeijing also faces grumbling by the United States, Japan, India and Russia that Belt and Road is a tool to build a China-centered political structure and erode their influence. American officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have told countries considering Belt and Road projects to look closely at Beijing’s motives and warned about debt.\n\n“BRI project financing will be a main topic for discussion” at the forum, said James Su of research firm Fitch Solutions in an email. He said Chinese leaders appear ready to discuss “more sustainable” financing to ease fears of a “debt trap.”\n\n“We see this as crucial for China as it seeks to reduce negative sentiment surrounding the initiative,” said Su.\n\nBeijing has given some borrowers more time to repay or made other concessions. Ethiopia’s Abiy reached agreement in September to extend repayment for a $4 billion railway linking his country with neighboring Djibouti from 10 years to 30 years.\n\nPakistan, which is building 22 Belt and Road projects including power plants and highways, has run into a debt crunch that forced it to ask the International Monetary Fund for an $8 billion bailout. But authorities say Prime Minister Imran Khan has no plans to ask China to renegotiate their deals during this week’s forum.\n\nChina has invested $13 billion in Pakistan and lent $6 billion for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a series of 22 projects.\n\nWashington argues the IMF shouldn’t help Pakistani repay Chinese lenders.\n\nDespite debt concerns, Ethiopia and other governments express support for Belt and Road and want more Chinese financing.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta plans to pursue a $3.7 billion loan from Beijing this week to extend a Chinese-built railway, his government’s ambassador to Beijing, Sarah Serem, told The Nation newspaper.\n\nThat is despite complaints the railway is unproductive and cannot pay for itself. The 962-kilometer (597-mile) project is intended to link Kenya with central Africa and Congo.\n\nKenya owes Chinese banks $3.2 billion for its first 472-kilometer (293-mile) link from the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa to the capital, Nairobi. Kenya is due to borrow almost $10 billion from Beijing for the full project.\n\nThe Nation said in September that Kenyatta wants China to pay for half of the next stage but other news reports said Beijing balked at that.\n\nBeijing scored a diplomatic coup in March when Italy became the first member of the Group of Seven major economies, which includes the United States, to sign an agreement to support Belt and Road.\n\nThe number of countries that have signed at least preliminary Belt and Road agreements has risen to 115 from 64 in 2013, according to the Chinese government.\n\n“As its relationship with the U.S. has soured, China is increasingly looking to the BRI to provide a tool for geopolitical influence,” said Moody’s analysts in a report in January.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, a 42-kilometer (26-mile) Chinese-built highway in Montenegro has prompted complaints the 810 million euro ($910 million) project is costly and wasteful.\n\n“The project is completely unfavorable for Montenegro,” said Ivan Kekovic, a civil engineer in Podgorica, the country’s capital.\n\nMontenegrin President Milo Djukanovic defended the deal, saying in an interview any contractors could bid but only Chinese companies submitted concrete proposals.\n\nIn the Indian Ocean, President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih of the Maldives says he wants to review the country’s Belt and Road projects and debt.\n\nChinese officials say Beijing is learning from experience and examining borrowers closely to make sure they can repay loans.\n\nPossibly due to tighter scrutiny, the number of new Belt and Road projects has plunged.\n\nThe total value of new contracts fell 42 percent in the first half of 2018 compared with a year earlier, according to Moody’s.\n\n___\n\nMunir Ahmed in Islamabad, Elias Meseret in Addis Ababa, Tom Odula in Nairobi, Roshan Sedhai in Kathmandu, Dusan Stojanovic in Belgrade and Stephen Wright in Jakarta contributed.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

After smooth sailing, BRI is now encountering strong headwinds, as partner nations worry about sovereignty eroding debt traps. In multiple countries, BRI projects are being scrapped or scaled back.India was the first country to come out against the opaque BRI, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s marquee initiative. India boycotted Xi’s much-hyped BRI summit, held to drum up global support for his initiative. The May 2017 summit in Beijing attracted 29 heads of state or government, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But, while the US sent a joint secretary equivalent official to the summit, India sent no one.Indeed, India publicly portrayed BRI as a non-transparent, neocolonial enterprise aimed at ensnaring smaller, cash-strapped states in a debt trap to help advance China’s geopolitical agenda. An official Indian statement before the BRI summit declared that “connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, the rule of law, openness, transparency and equality” and that they must also “follow principles of financial responsibility to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden”.Some commentators in India were quick to claim that, through its summit boycott, India had isolated itself. They also predicted that India would come out a loser by turning its back on what they saw as a promising infrastructure building initiative that New Delhi too should have tapped.But at the BRI summit itself, India received implicit support. The European Union openly echoed India’s concerns by saying BRI did not include commitments to transparency and social and environmental sustainability. The EU’s refusal to back Xi’s BRI-related trade statement marred the summit.Before long, the US began depicting BRI as the dawn of a new colonial era. Then US secretary of state Rex Tillerson called China a “new imperialist power” whose practices are “reminiscent of European colonialism”.The word “predatory” is now being used internationally about China’s practices. The International Monetary Fund has warned that Chinese loans are promoting unsustainable debt burdens. The price such burdens exact can extend to national sovereignty and self-respect. The handover of Hambantota port on a 99-year lease to China was seen in Sri Lanka as the equivalent of a heavily indebted farmer giving away his daughter to the cruel money lender.Beijing has leveraged big credits to gain even military presence, as its first overseas naval base at Djibouti illustrates. Trapped in a debt crisis after borrowing billions of dollars, Djibouti was left with no choice but to lease land for the base to China for $20 million in annual rent. China is similarly seeking to employ its leverage over cash-strapped Pakistan to build a naval base next to Gwadar port In the Maldives, China has acquired several islets in that heavily indebted Indian Ocean archipelago. While the terms of the various lease agreements have not been disclosed, the acquisitions have come cheap; for example, China paid just $4 million for Feydhoo Finolhu, an island that previously served as a police training centre.However, China’s grandiose BRI plans are running into broader resistance. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang by his side in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, recently criticised China’s use of infrastructure projects to spread its influence. By warning China against “a new version of colonialism”, Mahathir highlighted international concerns over Beijing’s use of geo-economic tools to achieve geopolitical objectives.Sri Lanka’s experience has been a wake-up call for other countries with outsize debts to China. A number of BRI partner-states have begun trying to renegotiate their deals with Beijing. Some have decided to cancel or scale back projects. Mahathir, during his Beijing visit, announced the cancellation of Chinese projects worth nearly $23 billion. And China’s close ally, Pakistan, has downsized its main BRI railroad project by $2 billion.BRI seeks to export China’s model of top-down, debt-driven development through government-to-government deals clinched without competitive bidding. But, increasingly, BRI is being seen internationally as an attempt to remake global commerce on China’s terms and project Chinese power far and wide.Vulnerable countries are awakening to the risks of accepting loans that are too good to be true and then slipping into debt entrapment. China is even replicating some of the practices that were used against it during the European colonial period, such as the concept of a 99-year lease. BRI, by creating a mountain of debt, risks undermining China’s international standing, including engendering hidden hostility. A broader pushback against China’s mercantilist practices is already emerging.Against this background, India’s brave, principled stand against BRI stands fully vindicated. India can pride itself as the intellectual leader that helped shine a spotlight on BRI’s financial and security risks and thereby moulded the international debate. The larger international pushback against China’s predatory practices is likely to intensify in the coming years, putting greater pressure on BRI.",

India has been trying to expand maritime cooperation with countries of the region including Sri Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Singapore, primarily with an aim to check the growing Chinese assertiveness.\n\nAccording to the Hudson Institute think-tank, the coronavirus pandemic threatens not only lives and livelihoods in South Asia; it could also be the precursor of significant political and strategic shifts in the region.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Bangladesh and Indian economies will survive the devastation, but their governments will have to restore growth by protecting and encouraging investment, the think-tank said in a report jointly authored by Indian-origin Hudson research scholar Aparna Pande and former Pakistan Ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani.\n\n“Pakistan and Sri Lanka will likely move in the direction of negative growth and will need debt relief from their international creditors. Without it, Sri Lanka faces the prospect of a sovereign debt default. Both countries are likely to look to China as their benefactor, as their leaders have tended to do for a while,” it said.\n\nAccording to the report titled “Crisis from Kolkata to Kabul: COVID-19’s Impact on South Asia”, China will most likely press its advantage by bailing out South Asia’s indebted governments, “in exchange for its pound of flesh“.\n\n“This would come at the expense of India’s security and US influence in the region. India and the United States must develop a plan to counter efforts China will likely make to strengthen its position in the Indian Ocean by deepening ties with Pakistan and Sri Lanka,” said the Hudson report, released this week.\n\nPakistan and Sri Lanka have been a target of Beijing’s ambitious Belt and Road (BRI) scheme, criticised for creating ‘debt traps’ by burdening fiscally weak countries with unsustainable debt.\n\nThe BRI is Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature global infrastructure policy. First announced in 2013, the project promises to build ports, roads and railways to revive the ancient Silk Road and create new trade corridors linking China to Asia, Africa and Europe. The BRI also includes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which India opposed as it goes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\nIn December 2017, Sri Lanka handed over the control of the southern sea port of Hambantota to China on a 99-year lease, triggering concern over Beijing’s efforts to expand influence in the Indian Ocean region.\n\nBeijing has recently granted an “urgent” loan of $500 million to Colombo to help it fight the virus, which has infected over 1,465 people and claimed 10 lives in the country.\n\nEarlier this month, China inked a $ 5.8 billion deal with Islamabad to build a dam in Gilgit-Baltistan, a move strongly opposed by India which said that carrying out such projects in territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation was not proper.\n\nThe IMF has recently approved a loan of $500 million to cash-strapped Pakistan to cope with the economic crisis being posed by the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected over 59,000 people and killed more than 1,220. The country has also sought additional loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to tide over the crisis.\n\nThe report said India’s initiative to develop a regional response to the threat posed by COVID-19 has been undermined by Pakistan’s insistence on raising the Kashmir issue even in this challenging time.\n\n“Given that Pakistan has fewer resources to further its military buildup against India, it is likely to escalate the use of sub conventional warfare (terrorism) in an effort to gain the upper hand against much-larger India,” the report noted.\n\nPakistan, it said, might seek relief from terrorism-related strictures on grounds that it needs space to deal with the coronavirus emergency.\n\nInternational pressure, especially Financial Action Task Force (FATF) gray-list sanctions targeting Pakistan, might be needed to restrain the worst anti-Indian impulses of its civil and military leaders, the report added.\n\nIn the past, Pakistan has used natural disasters to expand terrorist infiltrations into Kashmir and India. Indian officials are concerned that Pakistan could use the COVID-19 crisis as a distraction to do the same, the report observed.\n\n“Although a full-blown war in the subcontinent is unlikely, tensions between India and Pakistan will probably continue to impede efforts for regional cooperation. Such cooperation could ease the task of economic reconstruction that will almost certainly take place when the pandemic has died down. India could, and probably will, try to work with other countries in the region, but not Pakistan,” the report said.",

                        "docText": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — China and India are closely watching the constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka, which has been a battleground in their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia.\n\nChinese and Indian diplomats have been careful not to overtly take sides in the political turmoil, which has seen President Maithripala Sirisena oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, replace him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, and suspend Parliament.\n\nWickremesinghe, meanwhile, has holed up at the prime minister's residence and insisted he is Sri Lanka's rightful leader.\n\nThe caution exercised by the Asian giants stands in contrast to calls from Western diplomats for Parliament to immediately be summoned for a floor vote on Rajapaksa's appointment and underscores the economic and military importance the countries place on the Indian Ocean island nation.\n\n\"They're hedging their bets,\" said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director of the Atlantic Council's South Asia Center. India and China \"both have stakes in the global system and want to play a bigger role, so they have to signal they'll work with whomever.\"\n\nFor China, Sri Lanka is a critical link in its massive Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to use infrastructure projects to expand trade across a vast arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe. It has handed out billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade.\n\nLocated just 23 kilometers (14 miles) off its southeast coast, India sees Sri Lanka as a bulwark in its military defenses to ward off potential Chinese incursions and also sees the island as a key partner for regional trade. India has grown wary of China's economic influence over Sri Lanka and was troubled by a 2014 port visit from a Chinese submarine and warship.\n\nSri Lanka's ties to both nations date back thousands of years. It was a stop along China's old Silk Road trade routes, where merchants picked up pepper, cinnamon, ivory and pearl.\n\nSri Lanka traces much of its genealogy and culture to India, with folklore saying the island's majority Sinhalese are descendants of an Indian prince banished there 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe nation's minority Tamils, meanwhile, are in part the descendants of more than a million tea and rubber plantation workers brought to Sri Lanka from southern India by British colonial rulers in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nYet that hasn't always led to smooth relations. During Sri Lanka's decadeslong civil war, which pitted Tamil rebels against the government, India intervened in the 1980s by sending a peacekeeping force that quickly found itself engaged in battle with the rebels. They were asked to withdraw a few years later amid allegations of abuses against Tamils.\n\nChina filled the vacuum left by India, providing military assistance that helped the Rajapaksa-led government defeat the rebels in 2009. In 2012, China helped block a UN Human Rights Council resolution demanding that the Sri Lankan government investigate war crimes. It would later pass, but it prompted little action by Rajapaksa, who was in power from 2005 to 2015.\n\nChina is partly involved in the current crisis because of tensions over the billions of dollars of loans it has given to build a network of highways, the Hambantota seaport and airport in Rajapaksa's home district, and other projects. The most iconic of these has been the $1.5 billion port city being built on reclaimed land off Colombo's coast.\n\nSri Lanka's debt more than tripled during Rajapaksa's presidency, Sri Lankan Central Bank figures show.\n\nNew Delhi and other international critics have called the loans a debt trap.\n\nCentral bank figures , however, show that Sri Lanka's debt to India stood at 145 billion rupees (about $19.9 billion) in 2017 versus 135 billion rupees (about $18.5 billion) owed to China the same year.\n\nRajapaksa's defeat at the polls in 2015 was partly a reaction to all of that debt, said Gopalaswamy, the analyst.\n\nLikewise, Wickremesinghe, prime minster from 2015, saw his popularity begin to wane last year after his government handed over operations of the Hambantota port to a Chinese company in a 99-year lease.\n\n\"From a democracy perspective, there's been huge public resentment because the quality of these projects is questionable, there's little parliamentary scrutiny and no one knows where this money ends up,\" Gopalaswamy said.\n\nResponding to public outrage over the lease, China in July offered Sirisena a nearly $300 million grant that the president said could be used \"for any project of my wish.\"\n\nWith so much at stake, the Chinese ambassador to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan, was among the first to congratulate Rajapaksa after he was appointed prime minister on Oct. 27. But that day, Cheng also visited Temple Trees, the official prime minister's residence, where Wickremesinghe has been holed up since his ouster.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that Cheng's visits to rival prime ministers was simply part of China's policy of maintaining \"friendly exchanges will all parties in Sri Lanka,\" repeating China's routine assertion that it doesn't interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\nBut after the surprise win of an opposition candidate in the Maldives who campaigned on a promise to reduce China's role in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation, Sri Lanka's strategic position has increased. If projects in the Maldives are canceled, Sri Lanka would be China's main Indian Ocean link between Asia and the Seychelles, off the coast of East Africa.\n\nA spokesman for Sri Lanka's new government, Kehaliya Rambukwella, said Rajapaksa had spoken to Chinese officials about revising the terms of the Hambantota port lease.\n\nNew Delhi doesn't have many options for how to respond to the crisis, said G. Parthasarthy, a retired Indian diplomat and an expert on Sri Lanka affairs.\n\n\"We would like to see South Asia integrated much more closely with India, so we cannot be seen as taking sides,\" Parthasarthy said, adding that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe in separate visits to New Delhi last month.\n\nThe day after his ouster, Wickremesinghe met with Colombo-based diplomats from the U.S., Britain, Australia, the European Union and India, among others. Many issued statements calling for the country's constitution and democracy to be respected. Sirisena held his own meeting with foreign diplomats on Oct. 29.\n\nWickremesinghe said he hasn't received any official support from foreign powers, nor has he sought any.\n\n\"I agree with them that the constitution must be followed,\" he said.\n\nSince the crisis began, constitutional scholars have argued over whether Sri Lankan law allowed the president to remove the prime minster and appoint someone new.\n\nSirisena on Sunday ordered Parliament to reconvene Nov. 14 for a confidence vote on Rajapaksa. China and India will be closely watching to see if the vote eases or exacerbates the crisis.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Krishan Francis in Colombo and Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report.",

The CPEC is the flagship project of President Xi Jinping 's ambitious BRI.In the third such attack since May, militants opened fire on a patrolling paramilitary convoy in Panjgur district on Tuesday, killing three soldiers and wounding eight others, including an army colonel. Militant ethnic Baloch factions have also recently expanded their range of operations to adjoining Sindh province and its provincial capital Karachi, according to the report.Beijing's stakes in Sindh are as high as they are in Balochistan, it said.China's state-owned enterprises run container terminals at Karachi port and have invested in nuclear and coal power projects established both under the umbrella of the CPEC and in partnership with local corporations, it said.On June 29, four militants were killed by police commandos when they tried to shoot their way into the Karachi Stock Exchange, which is 40 per cent owned by a consortium of three Chinese bourses.“Baloch groups have not only intensified their attacks but also expanded the outreach of their terrorist violence beyond Balochistan, but it is hard to predict whether this trend will persist,” Mohammad Amir Rana, director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank, told the Post.He said Baloch insurgent factions had historically preferred to conduct low-intensity attacks, while their high-intensity attacks had tended to come in waves lasting “only for a few weeks”.Rana said the CPEC projects and Chinese personnel remained well protected by the dedicated 13,700-strong Special Security Division, led by a two-star Pakistani army general, established in 2017.“Only low-intensity attacks have been reported around the CPEC project sites, but the financial cost of the security [to Pakistan] is high,” he said.Beijing's political risks are also escalating because of a renewed wave of public anger in many parts of Balochistan against human rights abuses by Pakistani troops deployed to crush the low-intensity insurgency in the province, the report said.In June, Akhtar Mengal, leader of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal, parted ways with the ruling coalition led by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party, citing the government's failure to bring a halt to state-enforced disappearances.In a subsequent interview with the BBC's Urdu-language service, Mengal said more than 1,500 Baloch had “disappeared” since Prime Minister Khan took office in 2018 and claimed that he had personally secured the release of nearly 500 people from the custody of the security forces.Because of the political and security situation in Balochistan, China's CPEC investments in the province have hitherto been limited to the development of the Gwadar Port and a road linking it to the coastal highway to Karachi.The port is not yet fully operational and only recently handled its Afghan transhipment cargo. The city continues to suffer severe power and water shortages, the report said.Also, Chinese geopolitical interests at Gwadar, the Arabian Sea outlet of the corridor running overland from Xinjiang, have become caught up in a web of espionage and proxy warfare involving Pakistan and Iran, it said.Both have accused each other of allying with each other's nemeses, India and Saudi Arabia respectively, to support cross-border attacks, it said.Iran is highly suspicious of Pakistan and its relationship with arch-rival Saudi Arabia, especially since Riyadh was invited in late 2018 to establish a USD 10 billion oil refinery and storage facility at Gwadar.“The Iranians feel that Pakistan is not doing enough to secure the border on its side,” said Seyed Mohammed Marandi, a professor of English literature and oriental studies at the University of Tehran and renowned political commentator.“A lot of Saudi money has gone to extremist groups in this region and the Saudis have funded these [Jaish ul-Adl] terrorists,” he told the Post.Similarly, Pakistan is deeply concerned about India's involvement at Iran's Chabahar Port, which is competing with Gwadar for transit cargoes heading to landlocked Afghanistan.Politicians have warned that popular resentment towards federal government policies in Balochistan is dangerously close to igniting a wider uprising, it said.Pakistan's former president Asif Ali Zardari last month said the state needed “to be more careful in Balochistan”.Journalist Kiyya Baloch said Chinese security concerns would continue to drag on the pace at which CPEC projects in Gwadar have been developed.“Despite increasing diplomatic engagement, it is highly unlikely Beijing will make any significant further investment in Gwadar until security is improved,” Baloch said.",

China is building infrastructure in Pakistan including its restive Balochistan province where Pakistan army is fighting Baloch separatist rebels. Construction of nearly $60-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, is a string of energy and infrastructure projects.CPEC is presented by the Pakistani and Chinese governments as a lifeline to Pakistan's weak economy. The investment promises to create jobs and vital infrastructure as well as boost local industry. The 3,000 km project connects Pakistan's deep-water port Gwadar and China's Xinjiang.This is not the first attack on the Chinese by Baloch rebels. A few months ago, the son of a senior Baloch leader carried out a suicide attack on a bus carrying Chinese engineers in the Dalbandin region, injuring three Chinese nationals. Last year, two Chinese citizens working on CPEC were abducted and killed by the rebels.Balochistan, home to Gwadar Port, a key pillar of the CPEC, is embroiled in a separatist movement which has now dragged China into the conflict because of the presence of its engineers working on the project. China has been attempting to woo Baloch leaders and local political parties to safeguard CPEC, ET had reported in August, citing an anonymous expert on Sino-Pak affairs.But such efforts have not yielded desired results since Baloch leaders are not willing to compromise on their core demands, he said.Resource-rich Balochistan demands fair revenue from the projects in the area and greater political autonomy. The area where the attack took place is close to Pakistan’s eastern border with Iran which is also far from peaceful. According to the ET report, Rehan Baloch, the suicide bomber who attacked the Chinese in the Dalbandin region, had left this message: \"Through this act, I want to make China and its people realise (that) whosoever will try to meddle in Baloch issues without Baloch nation’s consent, will face the wrath of Baloch nation.”ET reported in October that Balochistan’s newly elected chief minister, Jam Kamal, had ordered authorities to immediately start teaching Chinese language to schoolchildren in Gwadar, a decision that signals further Sinification of Pakistan in the years ahead and a possible bigger backlash from the locals. ET was the first to report that China was building a city for 5,00,000 Chinese nationals at a cost of $150 million in Gwadar as part of the CPEC.China-Pak Investment Corporation bought the 3.6 million square foot International Port City for the purpose. By 2022, the proposed city is envisaged to house half a million Chinese citizens, comprising the workforce for the proposed financial district.Pakistan blames India for fomenting trouble in Balochistan where Gwadar is located. However, the Sinification of Pakistan is likely to face resistance from not just Baloch separatists. Due crackdown on Muslims by China in its restive Xinjiang province, Chinese may not be able to earn the trust of the citizens of the Muslim state.China has banned naming children 'Mohammad' in Xinjiang and had once ordered the Muslims to deposit copies of the Quran and other religious objects to the administration. Now it faces criticism from the international community for running camps to punish and discipline Muslims for religious activities.Despite the best efforts by the two countries, Pakistanis still show signs of distrust towards the Chinese expats. Last year, a national identity card for Pakistani citizens issued to a Chinese man kicked up storm when it circulated on Pakistani social media. Many Pakistanis saw it as the beginning of a Chinese invasion. Many others considered it morally wrong when Pakistan, a Muslim country, had yet to issue identity cards to Muslim refugees from Afghanistan. Some termed it \"the aftereffect of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor\". Despite China being Pakistan's all-weather friend, many Pakistanis look at it with suspicion. Many, including some top economists, regard CPEC as benefiting only China. Since Chinese companies import most of the inputs from China, not all Pakistani industries are benefiting from the project. Another worry is the repayment of huge and expensive loans.OBOR is China's grand vision of world domination by creating strategic assets in smaller countries, mostly in Asia and Africa. It works through an exploitative ploy. China's strategy to grab land and assets in smaller, less-developed countries is simple: it gives them loans on high rates for infrastructural projects, gets equity into projects, and when the country is unable to repay the loan, it gets ownership of the project.The Gwadar port is a key component of OBOR as it gives China access to sea lanes that can take its goods to the Gulf and African countries. That's why China wants to do all it can for smooth implementation of the CPEC projects even if it means talking to the rebels. However, given the increasing international scrutiny of China's repression of its own Muslim population, it may find it difficult to win confidence of Pakistanis.",

Recently on the advancement of the CPEC, we have noted that there are different comments and reports coming from the media.\"You can see that the new Pakistani government and Prime Minister (Khan) has made it clear that they will support the advancement of the CPEC,\" Lu said.He was apparently referring to the assurances by the new government in Islamabad about the continuation of the CPEC projects during the recent visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Pakistan.Lu said the CPEC served the economic and social development and referred to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) report which he said \"made it clear that the advancement of the CPEC did not cause any burden to Pakistan\".\"The IMF also said the CPEC from a long-term perspective will enhance Pakistan's capacity for the development,\" he said, adding that all the projects were conceived after extensive consultations with Pakistan.About the comments by some Pakistan officials to cut down the cost of the projects, he said: \"We should view such comments in a comprehensive way. Actually, the advancement of the CPEC is conducive to the inter-connectivity and prosperity of the region including Pakistan\".\"We hope you can see that the CPEC is very important project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),\" Li added.China had announced after the visit of Wang to Pakistan in September that the CPEC projects will be extended to the western areas of Pakistan, which included Balochistan.The CPEC is the flagship project of the multi-billion dollar BRI, a pet project of President Xi Jinping aimed at enhancing China's influence around the world through China-funded infrastructure projects.",

The bilateral relationship has withstood the test of times. Regardless of domestic or international changes, this close friendship has served as a model of state-to-state relations for other countries,\" he said.Highlighting that Pakistan and China are \"all-weather strategic cooperative partners\", the foreign minister said the bilateral ties have been further strengthened, particularly in the economic field, by the launch of the CPEC.Underscoring that the ambitious infrastructure project has added another important socio-economic development dimension to the bilateral relationship, Qureshi said, \"The leadership of both countries has expressed strong desire and commitment to the successful implementation of the CPEC.\"Beijing touts CPEC as the flagship infrastructure programme in its vast Belt and Road (BRI) Initiative.

The measures to be worked out by the IMF should not affect China-Pakistan relations, he said.\"As a member of the IMF, China supports the organisation having cooperation with Pakistan in objectively and professionally evaluating the situation on the ground in Pakistan,\" he said while answering questions on calls for scrutiny of Chinese loans by IMF and US officials.\"Also we support the IMF (helping Pakistan) in coping with the current difficulties. Their measures shall not affect normal bilateral cooperation between China and Pakistan,\" he said.He said the CPEC projects have been undertaken by the two governments under the principle of \"consultation and contribution for shared benefits\".The project and financing arrangements are made by the two sides on equal consultation, he said.\"In fact, judging from the debt structure already released by the Pakistani government their debt incurred from the CPEC accounts for low proportion. So, it is not the reason for Pakistan's financial difficulties,\" he said.Lu also said \"China would like to work with Pakistan to substantiate and expand the CPEC projects and help Pakistan to achieve development on its own strength\".After the new Pakistan government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan took over, China has agreed to extend the CPEC projects to the restive Balochistan province to address criticism that only the dominant Punjab province has grabbed most Chinese investments.India has also protested to China over CPEC as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The entire project is stated to be worth around USD 60 billion.On his recent visit to Pakistan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said there were currently 22 cooperation projects in Pakistan within the framework of the CPEC of which nine have been completed and 13 are under construction. The total investment of the projects is to the tune of USD 19 billion.A sense of unease prevailed in Beijing since the Khan-led government started taking a critical look at the CPEC projects in view of the difficult financial situation faced by Pakistan as well criticism over debt diplomacy being pursued by China by doling out excessive loans leaving countries in heavy debt.Umar said Pakistan's current year debt repayments were about USD 9 billion but obviously, it would not entirely be available from the IMF.Ahead of Umar's comments, both IMF and US officials spoke of concerns over the excessive loans obtained by Pakistan under the CPEC projects. The US said there was no rationale for the IMF to service Chinese debt and called for close scrutiny before extending a bailout package for Pakistan.The Trump administration has been critical of China's Belt and Road Initiative, saying that it has saddled some developing countries with debts they cannot afford to repay.In July, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was \"no rationale\" for an IMF bailout to Pakistan to pay off Chinese loans to Islamabad.On October 13, US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said Washington, a major stakeholder in the IMF, will examine closely Pakistan's request for loans, adding that \"part of the reason that Pakistan found itself in this situation is Chinese debt\".\"In all cases, we examine that closely from all angles of it, including Pakistan's debt position, in evaluating any type of loan programme,\" she said.IMF's chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said China's involvement besides bringing development to Pakistan could also bring potential risks.\"It is important that the design of the projects....be solid and excessive debts which cannot be repaid are avoided,\" he said.",

China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC), a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, has listed the security environment, bureaucratic delays and anti-China sentiments among other challenges associated with projects in Pakistan and labelled the country a “high-risk” proposition, said people aware of the matter.CHEC is involved in Gwadar Port, considered the crown jewel of CPEC. Besides CHEC, China Shipbuilding Offshore Corporation has underscored the grim security situation in Pakistan. It has categorised risks under eight sections – political instability under the Imran Khan government, social instability due to terrorist attacks, economic uncertainty and risk of payment default, Pakistani rupee’s volatility, Pakistan’s depleting forex reserves, higher rate of tax for Chinese companies in Pakistan, project delays and limited measures to control Covid-19 in recent months.Among other things, CHEC plans to build LNG terminals, a bridge at the Karachi Port and possibly a maintenance base for the Pakistan Navy for warships at the eastern side of the Gwadar Port, said those in the know. CHEC has suggested a few measures to improve the situation, including improving the image of China among Pakistanis, improvement in the security mechanism to prevent any attack on projects and training of Chinese workers in local laws in Pakistan. Chinese scholars have also pointed out that Pakistan is ridden with a plethora of challenges from regional disparities to ethnic separatism to religious conflicts to terrorism that often impact investment environment. Two studies, conducted by Henan Normal University and PLA Information Engineering University , have also expressed concern over the unrest in Balochistan.The CPEC is the most ambitious component of the Belt and Road Initiative. Originally valued at $47 billion, the value of CPEC projects has risen to $62 billion as of 2020. The CPEC was intended to rapidly upgrade Pakistan’s required infrastructure and strengthen its economy by the construction of modern transportation networks, numerous energy projects and special economic zones. The project violates India’s sovereignty as it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and is pushing Pakistan into a debt trap, according to critics.",

Pakistan’s The Dawn newspaper has reported that there have been allegations that the CPEC’s stewardship has effectively shifted from civilians to the military, following the appointment of a retired general as the head of CPEC Authority, the nodal organisation running the project.\n\nGen. Asim Saleem Bajwa — a former head of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), was appointed Chairman of CPEC Authority in November last year. On April 28, he also became Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Information and Broadcasting. By doing so, the military had openly positioned itself as the fount of decision-making on CPEC.\n\n“The Chinese always wanted the military to be in charge of running CPEC, as they were seen as more efficient and less corrupt,” a Chinese academic who did not wish to be named told The Hindu.\n\nRead: Editorial | A big, bad deal: On U.S.-Taliban agreement\n\nThe Dawn report further elaborated that senior politician Asad Umar was roped in as Pakistan’s Planning and Development Minister “on Chinese insistence,” after his return to Cabinet was announced in November. It further added that the first visible sign that CPEC had been rebooted emerged in November when the 300-megawatt Gwadar coal-fired power plant was inaugurated.\n\nThe Pakistani military’s stewardship has gelled with the decision that a large number of phase-2 projects would be rooted in Baluchistan — a strife-torn arid zone in the cross-hairs of an insurgency marshalled by groups such as the Afghanistan-based Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). Pakistan has accused India of backing BLA.\n\nPakistani media reports say that phase-2 CPEC undertakings are likely to include the $9.2 billion Peshawar to Karachi railway project. Besides, three Special Economic Zones (SEZs) — Rashakai, Allama Iqbal Industrial City and Dhabeji — would be at the heart of the phase-2 rollout meant to attract foreign investment and reverse Pakistan’s de-industrialisation.\n\nIn 2018, China and Pakistan had announced their intent to extend CPEC to resource-rich Afghanistan — a move that would link the landlocked country with Gwadar port, the starting point of the project, which terminates in Kashgar in China.\n\n“China has a larger vision of its engagement with Afghanistan, which is also driven by strong geoeconomic considerations. Afghanistan’s huge reserves of copper, and rare earths, including lithium — the feedstock of the batteries and new energy vehicles, is a major driver of China’s long-term engagement with Afghanistan,” says P. Stobdan, former Indian ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, in a conversation with The Hindu.\n\nChinese investments\n\nChina has already made modest investments in Afghanistan, which includes the Aynak copper mine project in 2008 and Amu Darya oil exploration in 2011.\n\nAfghanistan’s access to Gwadar has already been tested. In the third week of January, Diyala, a cargo ship carrying chemical fertilizer, docked in Gwadar. From there, the consignment was moved across by trucks to the Chaman border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This was done under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA), according to a write-up that appeared on the website of the Sydney-based Lowy Institute.\n\nBut the Afghans are not putting all their eggs in one basket. Last month, they also received a 75,000-tonne wheat shipment from India, which was routed through Chabahar — an India-run Iranian port on the Gulf of Oman, signalling their intent to diversify usage of trade routes.\n\nIn tune with its long-term geo-economic pursuits, China has already experimented with running trains to Afghanistan, linking the city of Nantong with Mazar-e-Sharif, in northern Afghanistan.\n\n“The killing of Osama bin Laden was a benchmark, as it marked the Obama administration’s policy to scale down American presence in Afghanistan. Ever since, China has given more and more importance to its bilateral ties with Afghanistan. China has to plug the resulting vacuum because no one else would. This is necessary to secure the One Belt One Road. Then there are compulsions of safeguarding the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Xinjiang’s stability is another big concern,” Hu Shisheng, Director of the Institute of South and Southeast Asian and Oceanian Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, had earlier told The Hindu.\n\nIn view of strengthening the logistical infrastructure along CPEC, Chinese state media announced late last month the construction of a high-altitude airport at Taxkorgan — a county that falls within the Shaksgam valley that Pakistan had ceded to China in 1963. “It will create a new ‘air passage’ leading to Central Asia and South Asia,” China Global Television Network (CGTN) quoted Zhou Xiang, deputy director of Xinjiang’s Civil Aviation Administration, as saying.",

It is not for other countries to comment on the internal affairs of India,” he said.\n\nXi is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Chennai later this week.\n\nBELT AND ROAD\n\nThe Chinese and Pakistani leaders also highlighted discussion around how to speed up progress on the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the $60 billion infrastructure program China launched as part of its flagship “Belt and Road” project.\n\nSome officials and observers have said momentum on CPEC is slowing, in part due to concerns over the size of Pakistan’s debt and struggling economy, which led Islamabad to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a $6 billion bailout package in July.\n\n“The two sides expressed determination to speedily execute CPEC so that its growth potential can be fully realized making it a high-quality demonstration project for BRI,” the governments said in a joint statement.\n\nKhan said that his government was setting up a “CPEC Authority” to expedite projects, and making arrangements to help Gwadar Port, a deep sea port in Pakistan’s southern Balochistan province, become a regional trade hub.\n\nKhan did not provide details on the plans, but earlier in the day Pakistan’s media reported that the maritime minister had announced China Overseas Ports Holding Company, which operates the port, would get a 23-year tax exemption for installation of machinery and other equipment at the port.",

ML-1 is the largest CPEC project and worth $6.8 billion. China is expected to lend $6 billion of this, which Pakistan wants to borrow at a concessional interest rate of less than 3%. But China is reluctant to lend money for ML-1 as it fears that local politics will delay returns on investment for China, ET has learnt.CPCE is governed by the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC). It is jointly chaired by Pakistan's minister for planning, development and special initiatives and the vice chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission. The first JCC meeting was held in August 2013 and the last in November 2019. The 10th JCC was scheduled for early 2020 but could not be held due to disagreement between Beijing and Islamabad.Asad Umar, Pakistan's minister for planning, development and special initiatives, told local media in November that the 10th JCC would be held the following month. However, sources informed that meeting could not be held yet.China extends of concessionary and commercial loans for big projects under BRI . \"China is reluctant to lend money for ML-1 because Pakistan has already sought debt relief to meet G-20 lending conditions and it is not in a position to give sovereign guarantees,\" Nasir Jamal, a senior journalist in Lahore covering business and the economy, told leading Nikkei, a leading media outlet from Japan.Andrew Small, a senior trans-Atlantic fellow with the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund, a U.S. think tank, told Nikkei \"China is much more comfortable deferring payments or providing new financing than it is offering concessional rates in the first place. This approach provides Beijing with greater leverage and control even if they are willing to be very flexible at the back-end.”Earlier this month, Pakistan Railways asked the government for 11 billion rupees ($69 million) to provide ML-1 security. It is hard for Islamabad to extend a large amount given the state of the economy and severe budgetary constraints.The other major disagreement between Beijing and Islamabad delaying the JCC meeting relates to SEZs, sources told ET. In the second phase of CPEC scheduled for 2020 to 2025, Chinese companies are due to start producing goods in Pakistan and exporting from there.In the past, JCCs were always held in time, and China agreed to Islamabad's requests most of the time. There were plenty of announcements about CPEC last year, but implanting it is another matter.Pakistan is currently renegotiating its $6 billion extended fund facility with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was suspended last April. The IMF reportedly will only resume the program if Pakistan does not borrow any new commercial loans, and this is one of the reasons it is looking for concessions on loans for the ML-1 project.",

                        "docText": "The impending withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan is sharpening the focus on the second phase of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which appears to have been fused with a larger regional plan involving Afghanistan and Central Asia.\n\nAnalysts point out that while working together on the second phase, China and Pakistan are engaged in more firmly pegging Afghanistan — the gateway to Central Asia — with CPEC.\n\nUnhappy with CPEC’s anaemic progression after early 2017, the Chinese have apparently put their foot down, exhorting cash-strapped Pakistan to take some key decisions. Pakistan’s The Dawn newspaper has reported that there have been allegations that the CPEC’s stewardship has effectively shifted from civilians to the military, following the appointment of a retired general as the head of CPEC Authority, the nodal organisation running the project.\n\nGen. Asim Saleem Bajwa — a former head of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), was appointed Chairman of CPEC Authority in November last year. On April 28, he also became Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Information and Broadcasting. By doing so, the military had openly positioned itself as the fount of decision-making on CPEC.\n\n“The Chinese always wanted the military to be in charge of running CPEC, as they were seen as more efficient and less corrupt,” a Chinese academic who did not wish to be named told The Hindu.\n\nRead: Editorial | A big, bad deal: On U.S.-Taliban agreement\n\nThe Dawn report further elaborated that senior politician Asad Umar was roped in as Pakistan’s Planning and Development Minister “on Chinese insistence,” after his return to Cabinet was announced in November. It further added that the first visible sign that CPEC had been rebooted emerged in November when the 300-megawatt Gwadar coal-fired power plant was inaugurated.\n\nThe Pakistani military’s stewardship has gelled with the decision that a large number of phase-2 projects would be rooted in Baluchistan — a strife-torn arid zone in the cross-hairs of an insurgency marshalled by groups such as the Afghanistan-based Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). Pakistan has accused India of backing BLA.\n\nPakistani media reports say that phase-2 CPEC undertakings are likely to include the $9.2 billion Peshawar to Karachi railway project. Besides, three Special Economic Zones (SEZs) — Rashakai, Allama Iqbal Industrial City and Dhabeji — would be at the heart of the phase-2 rollout meant to attract foreign investment and reverse Pakistan’s de-industrialisation.\n\nIn 2018, China and Pakistan had announced their intent to extend CPEC to resource-rich Afghanistan — a move that would link the landlocked country with Gwadar port, the starting point of the project, which terminates in Kashgar in China.\n\n“China has a larger vision of its engagement with Afghanistan, which is also driven by strong geoeconomic considerations. Afghanistan’s huge reserves of copper, and rare earths, including lithium — the feedstock of the batteries and new energy vehicles, is a major driver of China’s long-term engagement with Afghanistan,” says P. Stobdan, former Indian ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, in a conversation with The Hindu.\n\nChinese investments\n\nChina has already made modest investments in Afghanistan, which includes the Aynak copper mine project in 2008 and Amu Darya oil exploration in 2011.\n\nAfghanistan’s access to Gwadar has already been tested. In the third week of January, Diyala, a cargo ship carrying chemical fertilizer, docked in Gwadar. From there, the consignment was moved across by trucks to the Chaman border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This was done under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA), according to a write-up that appeared on the website of the Sydney-based Lowy Institute.\n\nBut the Afghans are not putting all their eggs in one basket. Last month, they also received a 75,000-tonne wheat shipment from India, which was routed through Chabahar — an India-run Iranian port on the Gulf of Oman, signalling their intent to diversify usage of trade routes.\n\nIn tune with its long-term geo-economic pursuits, China has already experimented with running trains to Afghanistan, linking the city of Nantong with Mazar-e-Sharif, in northern Afghanistan.\n\n“The killing of Osama bin Laden was a benchmark, as it marked the Obama administration’s policy to scale down American presence in Afghanistan. Ever since, China has given more and more importance to its bilateral ties with Afghanistan. China has to plug the resulting vacuum because no one else would. This is necessary to secure the One Belt One Road. Then there are compulsions of safeguarding the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Xinjiang’s stability is another big concern,” Hu Shisheng, Director of the Institute of South and Southeast Asian and Oceanian Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, had earlier told The Hindu.\n\nIn view of strengthening the logistical infrastructure along CPEC, Chinese state media announced late last month the construction of a high-altitude airport at Taxkorgan — a county that falls within the Shaksgam valley that Pakistan had ceded to China in 1963. “It will create a new ‘air passage’ leading to Central Asia and South Asia,” China Global Television Network (CGTN) quoted Zhou Xiang, deputy director of Xinjiang’s Civil Aviation Administration, as saying.",

Originally valued at $46 billion, the CPEC projects were worth $62 billion as of 2017.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative aims to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea route.\n\nIndia, the U.S. and several other countries have been highlighting the concerns over China’s ambitious BRI projects which may leave a number of smaller countries in debt traps. The concerns grew louder after China took over Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port on a 99-year lease.",

                        "docText": "An attack by separatist group Balochistan Liberation Army on the Chinese consulate in Karachi in Pakistan has once again exposed the risks to Pakistan-China business relations. China is building infrastructure in Pakistan including its restive Balochistan province where Pakistan army is fighting Baloch separatist rebels. Construction of nearly $60-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, is a string of energy and infrastructure projects.CPEC is presented by the Pakistani and Chinese governments as a lifeline to Pakistan's weak economy. The investment promises to create jobs and vital infrastructure as well as boost local industry. The 3,000 km project connects Pakistan's deep-water port Gwadar and China's Xinjiang.This is not the first attack on the Chinese by Baloch rebels. A few months ago, the son of a senior Baloch leader carried out a suicide attack on a bus carrying Chinese engineers in the Dalbandin region, injuring three Chinese nationals. Last year, two Chinese citizens working on CPEC were abducted and killed by the rebels.Balochistan, home to Gwadar Port, a key pillar of the CPEC, is embroiled in a separatist movement which has now dragged China into the conflict because of the presence of its engineers working on the project. China has been attempting to woo Baloch leaders and local political parties to safeguard CPEC, ET had reported in August, citing an anonymous expert on Sino-Pak affairs.But such efforts have not yielded desired results since Baloch leaders are not willing to compromise on their core demands, he said.Resource-rich Balochistan demands fair revenue from the projects in the area and greater political autonomy. The area where the attack took place is close to Pakistan’s eastern border with Iran which is also far from peaceful. According to the ET report, Rehan Baloch, the suicide bomber who attacked the Chinese in the Dalbandin region, had left this message: \"Through this act, I want to make China and its people realise (that) whosoever will try to meddle in Baloch issues without Baloch nation’s consent, will face the wrath of Baloch nation.”ET reported in October that Balochistan’s newly elected chief minister, Jam Kamal, had ordered authorities to immediately start teaching Chinese language to schoolchildren in Gwadar, a decision that signals further Sinification of Pakistan in the years ahead and a possible bigger backlash from the locals. ET was the first to report that China was building a city for 5,00,000 Chinese nationals at a cost of $150 million in Gwadar as part of the CPEC.China-Pak Investment Corporation bought the 3.6 million square foot International Port City for the purpose. By 2022, the proposed city is envisaged to house half a million Chinese citizens, comprising the workforce for the proposed financial district.Pakistan blames India for fomenting trouble in Balochistan where Gwadar is located. However, the Sinification of Pakistan is likely to face resistance from not just Baloch separatists. Due crackdown on Muslims by China in its restive Xinjiang province, Chinese may not be able to earn the trust of the citizens of the Muslim state.China has banned naming children 'Mohammad' in Xinjiang and had once ordered the Muslims to deposit copies of the Quran and other religious objects to the administration. Now it faces criticism from the international community for running camps to punish and discipline Muslims for religious activities.Despite the best efforts by the two countries, Pakistanis still show signs of distrust towards the Chinese expats. Last year, a national identity card for Pakistani citizens issued to a Chinese man kicked up storm when it circulated on Pakistani social media. Many Pakistanis saw it as the beginning of a Chinese invasion. Many others considered it morally wrong when Pakistan, a Muslim country, had yet to issue identity cards to Muslim refugees from Afghanistan. Some termed it \"the aftereffect of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor\". Despite China being Pakistan's all-weather friend, many Pakistanis look at it with suspicion. Many, including some top economists, regard CPEC as benefiting only China. Since Chinese companies import most of the inputs from China, not all Pakistani industries are benefiting from the project. Another worry is the repayment of huge and expensive loans.OBOR is China's grand vision of world domination by creating strategic assets in smaller countries, mostly in Asia and Africa. It works through an exploitative ploy. China's strategy to grab land and assets in smaller, less-developed countries is simple: it gives them loans on high rates for infrastructural projects, gets equity into projects, and when the country is unable to repay the loan, it gets ownership of the project.The Gwadar port is a key component of OBOR as it gives China access to sea lanes that can take its goods to the Gulf and African countries. That's why China wants to do all it can for smooth implementation of the CPEC projects even if it means talking to the rebels. However, given the increasing international scrutiny of China's repression of its own Muslim population, it may find it difficult to win confidence of Pakistanis.",

The measures to be worked out by the IMF should not affect China-Pakistan relations, he said.\"As a member of the IMF, China supports the organisation having cooperation with Pakistan in objectively and professionally evaluating the situation on the ground in Pakistan,\" he said while answering questions on calls for scrutiny of Chinese loans by IMF and US officials.\"Also we support the IMF (helping Pakistan) in coping with the current difficulties. Their measures shall not affect normal bilateral cooperation between China and Pakistan,\" he said.He said the CPEC projects have been undertaken by the two governments under the principle of \"consultation and contribution for shared benefits\".The project and financing arrangements are made by the two sides on equal consultation, he said.\"In fact, judging from the debt structure already released by the Pakistani government their debt incurred from the CPEC accounts for low proportion. So, it is not the reason for Pakistan's financial difficulties,\" he said.Lu also said \"China would like to work with Pakistan to substantiate and expand the CPEC projects and help Pakistan to achieve development on its own strength\".After the new Pakistan government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan took over, China has agreed to extend the CPEC projects to the restive Balochistan province to address criticism that only the dominant Punjab province has grabbed most Chinese investments.India has also protested to China over CPEC as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The entire project is stated to be worth around USD 60 billion.On his recent visit to Pakistan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said there were currently 22 cooperation projects in Pakistan within the framework of the CPEC of which nine have been completed and 13 are under construction. The total investment of the projects is to the tune of USD 19 billion.A sense of unease prevailed in Beijing since the Khan-led government started taking a critical look at the CPEC projects in view of the difficult financial situation faced by Pakistan as well criticism over debt diplomacy being pursued by China by doling out excessive loans leaving countries in heavy debt.Umar said Pakistan's current year debt repayments were about USD 9 billion but obviously, it would not entirely be available from the IMF.Ahead of Umar's comments, both IMF and US officials spoke of concerns over the excessive loans obtained by Pakistan under the CPEC projects. The US said there was no rationale for the IMF to service Chinese debt and called for close scrutiny before extending a bailout package for Pakistan.The Trump administration has been critical of China's Belt and Road Initiative, saying that it has saddled some developing countries with debts they cannot afford to repay.In July, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was \"no rationale\" for an IMF bailout to Pakistan to pay off Chinese loans to Islamabad.On October 13, US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said Washington, a major stakeholder in the IMF, will examine closely Pakistan's request for loans, adding that \"part of the reason that Pakistan found itself in this situation is Chinese debt\".\"In all cases, we examine that closely from all angles of it, including Pakistan's debt position, in evaluating any type of loan programme,\" she said.IMF's chief economist Maurice Obstfeld said China's involvement besides bringing development to Pakistan could also bring potential risks.\"It is important that the design of the projects....be solid and excessive debts which cannot be repaid are avoided,\" he said.",

It may be recalled that China has decided to invest $62 billion for the CPEC project.Under the plan, thousands of acres of agricultural land will be leased out to Chinese enterprises in Pakistan to set up “demonstration projects” in areas ranging from seed varieties to irrigation technology.A system of monitoring and surveillance will be built in cities from Peshawar to Karachi with 24-hour video recording on roads and busy marketplaces for law and order.Besides, as the per master plan, a national fibre-optic backbone will be built for Pakistan not only for internet traffic, but also terrestrial distribution of broadcast TV, which will cooperate with Chinese media in the “dissemination of Chinese culture”. A similar Sinification is visible in the Mandalay town of Myanmar which has impacted local architecture and culture. It remains to be seen how a conservative section of the Pakistani society reacts to the influence of Chinese culture.In some areas, the plan is to build on a market presence already established by Chinese enterprises -- for instance, Haier in household appliances, China Mobile and Huawei in telecommunications, and China Metallurgical Group Corporation in mining and minerals.A key thrust of the plan lies in agriculture. Pakistan will also become a market for agricultural produce from Western China and this will adversely impact local producers, alleged Pakistani civil society activists. From provision of seeds and other inputs, such as fertiliser, credit and pesticides, Chinese enterprises will also operate their own farms, processing facilities for fruits and vegetables and grain. Logistics companies will operate a large storage and transportation system for agrarian produce, as per the CPEC master plan. Chinese enterprises will take the lead in each field.Experts on Chinese economy claim that Beijing’s goal through CPEC is to improve the agriculture sector of certain western provinces. The plan proposes to harness the work of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to bring mechanization as well as scientific technique in livestock breeding, development of hybrid varieties and precision irrigation to Pakistan. It sees its main opportunity as helping the Kashgar Prefecture, a territory within the larger Xinjiang Autonomous Zone, which is poverty ridden.FIBRE OPTIC WORRIESOne of the oldest priorities for the Chinese government since talks on CPEC began is fibre optic connectivity between China and Pakistan. An MoU for such a link was signed in July 2013 which may impact India’s security. “Moreover, China’s telecom services to Africa need to be transferred in Europe, so there’s a certain hidden danger of the overall security,” says the plan.The plan also envisages a terrestrial cable across the Khunjerab pass to Islamabad, and a submarine landing station of cable in Gwadar. Gwadar, as per the plan, “is positioned as the direct hinterland connecting Balochistan and Afghanistan”.The expanded bandwidth will enable terrestrial broadcast of digital HD television, called Digital Television Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB). This is envisioned as more than just a technological contribution. According to the master plan, “It is a cultural transmission carrier. The future cooperation between Chinese and Pakistani media will be beneficial to disseminating Chinese culture in Pakistan, further enhancing mutual understanding between the two peoples and the traditional friendship between the two countries.”“There is a plan to build a pilot safe city in Peshawar, which faces a fairly severe security situation in northwestern Pakistan,” the plan says, following which the initiative will be extended to major cities such as Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. This may see deployment of Chinese forces in Pakistan with a direct bearing on Indian security.Importantly, Pakistan’s federal and involved local governments should also bear part of the responsibility for financing through issuing sovereign guarantee, according to the plan.",

The bilateral relationship has withstood the test of times. Regardless of domestic or international changes, this close friendship has served as a model of state-to-state relations for other countries,\" he said.Highlighting that Pakistan and China are \"all-weather strategic cooperative partners\", the foreign minister said the bilateral ties have been further strengthened, particularly in the economic field, by the launch of the CPEC.Underscoring that the ambitious infrastructure project has added another important socio-economic development dimension to the bilateral relationship, Qureshi said, \"The leadership of both countries has expressed strong desire and commitment to the successful implementation of the CPEC.\"Beijing touts CPEC as the flagship infrastructure programme in its vast Belt and Road (BRI) Initiative. The CPEC connects China's Xinjiang province with Gwadar , a port city in Balochistan, through a rail, road and pipeline network.India is opposed to the CPEC as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir Qureshi said, \"Pakistan considers the CPEC as an engine for growth; a catalyst for economic development, and a platform for socio-economic uplift of the people of Pakistan.\"The IMF had said it would closely scrutinise the CPEC projects and the US is opposed to the use of IMF money to service the Chinese loans.An assessment by the State Bank of Pakistan and the Finance Ministry showed that Pakistan needed USD 11.7 billion to service its external debt in the current fiscal year 2018-19.The US has said the debts accrued on the CPEC projects were to blame for Pakistan's current economic crisis, a statement which was rejected by both Beijing and Islamabad.On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang had told the media in Beijing that Khan's first visit will provide an opportunity for two countries to \"open a new chapter of development of bilateral relations under the new circumstances\".",

It's very interconnected so if you get an attack in one place it tends to spread.\"\n\nMr Manning blamed a lack of time and resources but also \"frankly a lack of focus, a lack of taking it seriously\" for individual NHS organisations' failure to keep up with cyber-security improvements.\n\n\"This was an extremely unsophisticated attack,\" he added.\n\nThe NAO said the NHS \"has accepted that there are lessons to learn\" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan.\n\nIt will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said.\n\nWannaCry was \"a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice,\" said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO.\n\n\"There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks.\"\n\nKeith McNeil, NHS chief clinical information officer for health and care, said: \"As the NAO report makes clear, no harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen.\n\n\"Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hard-working NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care, keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nAnalysis - by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent\n\nFor many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning.\n\nSo what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.\n\nTo be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts. When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do.\n\nOf course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS. Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit.\n\nIn one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse.\n\nCyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem. And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.",

Damn nuisance.\n\nAnalysis: Why do companies still use Windows XP?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?\n\nBy Chris Foxx, technology reporter\n\nMany jobs can be done using software everyone can buy, but some businesses need programs that perform very specific jobs - so they build their own.\n\nFor example. a broadcaster might need specialist software to track satellite feeds coming into a newsroom or a hospital might need custom-built tools to analyse X-ray images.\n\nDeveloping niche software can be very expensive: programming, testing, maintenance and continued development all adds up.\n\nThen along comes a new version of Windows, and the software isn't compatible. Companies face the cost of upgrading computers and operating system licences, as well as rebuilding their software from scratch.\n\nSo, some choose to keep running the old version of Windows instead. In some businesses, that's not a huge risk, but in a hospital the stakes are higher.\n\nHow did the attack work?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Experts discuss the attack: \"The most terrifying thing about this is how simple it is\"\n\nThe ransomware used in the attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems.\n\nIt encrypts files on a user's computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again.\n\nThe virus is usually covertly installed on to computers by hiding within emails containing links, which users are tricked into opening.\n\nSome experts say the attackers used a weakness in Microsoft systems which is known to the US National Security Agency as \"EternalBlue\".\n\nA cybersecurity researcher tweeting as @malwaretechblog has claimed to have found a way to slow down the spread of the virus after registering a domain name hidden in the malware.\n\nThey said that the malware makes a request to a domain name, but if it is live the malware stops spreading.\n\nA security update - or patch - was released by Microsoft in March to protect against the virus, but it appears many organisations have not applied the patch - or may still be using outdated systems like Windows XP.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning",

The virus took control of users' files and demanded $300 (£230) payments to restore access.\n\nThe spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack slowed over the weekend but the respite might only be brief, experts have said. More than 200,000 computers have been affected so far.\n\nRead more:\n\nBBC analysis of three accounts linked to the ransom demands suggests about $38,000 (£29,400) had been paid by Monday morning.\n\nHowever, the ransomware warning said that the cost would double after three days, so the payments may increase. It threatens to delete files within seven days if no payment is made.\n\nThe effect in Asian nations so far on Monday has been limited. South Korea said just nine cases of ransomware had been found, giving no further details.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?\n\nAustralian officials said so far only three small-to-medium sized businesses had reported being locked out of their systems while New Zealand's ministry of business said a small number of unconfirmed incidents were being investigated.\n\nIn Japan, both Nissan and Hitachi reported some units had been affected, while in China energy giant PetroChina said that at some petrol stations customers had been unable to use its payment system.\n\n'Like stealing Tomahawks'\n\nA statement from Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith on Sunday criticised the way governments store up information about security flaws in computer systems.\n\n\"We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world,\" he wrote.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Firms must patch their systems before Monday morning, Europol chief warns\n\n\"An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.\"\n\nHe added: \"The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.\"\n\nThe organisation also said that many organisations had failed to keep their systems up to date, allowing the virus to spread.\n\nMicrosoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it.\n\n\"As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems,\" Mr Smith said.\n\nAnalysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter\n\nThere are going to be some tough questions on Monday for those institutions which didn't do enough to keep their networks secure, as well as the organisations that were best placed to stop it happening in the first place - the NSA and Microsoft.\n\nThe NSA keeps a chest of cyberweapons to itself so it can hit targets, but Microsoft has long argued that this is dangerous. If there is a flaw in Windows, the company said, surely the safest thing to do is to let its team know straight away so it can be fixed.\n\nBut then Microsoft also needs to consider what obligation it has to update all users - not just the ones who pay extra for security on older systems.\n\nUpdating your computer if you're an individual is a piece of cake, but for a network the size of Britain's National Health Service? Tough - time-consuming, expensive and complex.\n\nFor a company like Microsoft to say it won't keep those systems safe unless they shell out more money, then that in itself is something of a ransom.\n\nMeanwhile Europol's chief told the BBC the ransomware was designed to allow \"infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks\", adding: \"That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time.\"\n\nAlthough a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the virus, he said.\n\nA UK security researcher known as \"MalwareTech\", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted \"another one coming... quite likely on Monday\".\n\nMalwareTech, whose name was revealed in UK media to be 22-year-old Marcus Hutchins, was hailed as an \"accidental hero\" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nBecky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, told AFP news agency that it would be easy for the initial attackers or \"copy-cat authors\" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against.\n\n\"Even if a fresh attack does not materialise on Monday, we should expect it soon afterwards,\" she said.\n\nIn England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.\n\nOther organisations targeted worldwide included Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, French carmaker Renault, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's Interior Ministry.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning",

                        "docText": "Insurers are inadvertently funding organised crime by paying out claims from companies who have paid ransoms to regain access to data and systems after a hacking attack, Britain’s former top cybersecurity official has warned.\n\nCiaran Martin, who ran the National Cyber Security Centre until last August, said he feared that so-called ransomware was “close to getting out of control” and that there was a risk that NHS systems could be hit during the pandemic.\n\nThe problem, he said, is being fuelled because there is no legal barrier to companies paying ransoms to cyber gangs – typically from Russia and some other former Soviet states – and claiming back on insurance. “People are paying bitcoin to criminals and claiming back cash,” Martin said.\n\n“I see this as so avoidable. At the moment, companies have incentives to pay ransoms to make sure this all goes away,” the former intelligence chief said. “You have to look seriously about changing the law on insurance and banning these payments, or at the very least, having a major consultation with the industry”.\n\nBritain’s extortion laws prohibit the payment of ransoms to terrorists, and were drawn up largely in response to the threat of kidnapping. But cyber-attacks are not carried out by terror groups, and so there is no bar to paying ransom demands – and it is possible to make an insurance claim if no personal data was involved.\n\nCriminal hacking groups tend to be based in Russia and former Soviet states outside the Baltic region, Martin said, operating while the Kremlin and other governments in the region turn a blind eye to their activities.\n\nSome groups claim they have made so much money they are publicly announcing their “retirement” on line, while the Wizard Spider or RYUK gang is estimated to have made $150m from online extortion according to a study of bitcoin transactions.\n\nSo called ransomware attacks involve groups hacking into and seizing control of corporate data systems. The gangs demand money – typically up to $10m a time – to give back access to the systems. “Attackers often set great store in being reliable once you have paid them, providing testimony from involuntary customers,” Martin said.\n\nTravelex, a UK-based provider of foreign exchange services, paid $2.3m last year to regain control after hackers shut down its networks, but the company subsequently fell into administration and had to be restructured with the loss of 1,300 jobs. Smartwatch maker Garmin also reportedly paid to recover files, after suffering a crippling attack last summer.\n\nCriminal attackers say they will not target hospitals or health centres, believing that such an attack would have wider diplomatic repercussions. But Martin said the worry is that IT systems do not readily identify themselves online, so a mistaken attack with wider consequences remains possible.\n\nIn 2017, NHS systems were among those seriously disrupted by the WannaCry attack, which emerged from North Korea. Although not a ransomware attack, the disruption caused to hospital systems demonstrates how serious the health sector could be affected in the UK and elsewhere.\n\nGerman police launched an investigation in September after a woman died during a cyber-attack on a hospital in Dusseldorf. Doctors had been attempting to transfer the patient to another facility 30km away.\n\nOther recent ransomware attacks have been conducted against EuroFins, a Belgian company that provides forensic services and disrupted police investigations in England and Wales, and elsewhere for some months although this was not widely reported at the time. It too reportedly paid a ransom.\n\nGangs often scout their targets and will tailor their demands to the size of the customer – there are even examples of small businesses such as hairdressers being targeted and payments of £1,500 being demanded.\n\nCompanies who have effective backups and can otherwise shrug off a hacker attack also find themselves under pressure to pay, because gangs are now threatening to leak stolen data online, an evolution of the classic ransomware model.\n\nMartin said it was difficult to track the level of ransomware activity, because there was a lack of disclosure obligations, unless personal data is involved. But he added that he regretted not being able to change the law during his time in government and action was needed soon.\n\n“In the last year, experts are saying this is close to getting out of control,” the former intelligence agency chief said. “The law is nobody’s fault, it was written for another purpose, but it has become OK to pay out to criminals”.\n\n\n\n",

Getty\n\nAs leading cybercrime gangs promise not to attack healthcare organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, can we take them at their word?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic continues to bring out the best in so many people as individuals, communities and businesses combine in the fight against COVID-19. It has also exposed the worse sides of some, from those clearing the supermarket shelves and preventing vulnerable people from getting the supplies they need, to profiteering companies. Then there are the cyber-criminals exploiting fear and the need for information to spread malware and defraud victims. But could the criminals be having a change of heart? The cybercrime groups behind two of the most prolific ransomware threats have issued statements that they will not attack healthcare and medical targets during the coronavirus crisis. The problem with this is twofold: can you take a criminal gang at their word, and can they prevent healthcare organizations from getting caught in the attack crossfire even if they wanted to?\n\nThe COVID-19 ransomware threat\n\nRansomware continues to be one of the most severe threats facing organizations of all kinds, especially as attack methods continue to evolve. Like any criminal enterprise, the gangs behind the operation of ransomware will exploit current concerns to infect victims. The coronavirus pandemic is, sadly, not exempt from this. We've already seen COVID-19 infection distribution maps laced with malware, and the U.S. Attorney, Scott Brady, has warned people to be wary of an \"unprecedented\" wave of coronavirus scams.\n\nRansomware cybercrime gangs promise to give healthcare a free pass\n\nLawrence Abrams, the creator of BleepingComputer, reached out to the cybercrime groups behind the operation of some of the most prolific and dangerous ransomware threats. Abrams asked a simple question: will you continue to target health and medical organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic? At the time of writing, two had replied and their answers might surprise many readers. The first to respond were the operators of the DoppelPaymer ransomware threat, who told Abrams that they \"always try to avoid hospitals, nursing homes.\" When attacking local government targets, they \"do not touch 911,\" although sometimes emergency communications are hit due to network misconfigurations.\n\nInterestingly, the DoppelPaymer cybercrime group has said that if a medical or healthcare organization does get hit by mistake, then it will provide a free decrypter code. \"If we do it by mistake, we'll decrypt for free,\" the threat actors said, although pharmaceutical companies are not included in this ransomware amnesty. \"They earn a lot of extra on panic,\" the criminals said, adding that they have \"no wish to support them.\"\n\nDoppelPaymer is an example of what Microsoft refers to as human-operated ransomware, causing havoc with ransom demands that use exfiltrated data as leverage. This is where the promises not to target health organizations fall a little flat; the risk to third parties remains. Ask Lockheed Martin, SpaceX and Tesla who were victims of the kind of collateral damage that DoppelPaymer can cause. Although not infected by the ransomware themselves, sensitive documents belonging to them and exfiltrated from a parts supplier, which did fall victim, were published by the cyber-criminals.\n\nMaze ransomware criminals confirm they will stop attacking medical organizations\n\nThe operators of the Maze ransomware threat also said they would stop attacking medical organizations until \"the stabilization of the situation with the virus.\" The Maze actors did not confirm whether a decrypter would be available if healthcare organizations are infected unintentionally. However, security vendor Emsisoft, in partnership with incident response outfit Coveware, emailed me to confirm that it will be offering a completely free of charge ransomware recovery service to critical care hospitals and other healthcare providers. This includes the development of a decryption tool where possible.\n\nAt the time of writing, there has been no such promise from the criminals behind the Ryuk threat. Ryuk was the ransomware that recently took down North Carolina city and county government systems, and led to the City of New Orleans declaring a state of emergency as 2019 came to an end.\n\nSelf-preservation and not altruism\n\n\"If this announcement from ransomware operators, also known as cybercriminals, is accurate, it is motivated by self-preservation and not altruism,\" Ian Thornton-Trump, CISO at Cyjax, says. He bases this on the fact that the law-enforcement response to any such attack during a time of crisis like this would be \"overwhelming.\" And that's before even considering the military and intelligence agency resources that could be thrown at criminals attacking critical healthcare targets during a pandemic. \"The last thing cybercriminals want is an APT actor's offensive capabilities deployed against them,\" Thornton-Trump told me, \"a particularly spectacular and effective ransomware attack may even elicit military action up to and including a special forces mission to take out the actors responsible for the cyber-attack.\"\n\nThe criminals promise could be hard to implement in the real world where external facing IP addresses will not necessarily identify a target as being a healthcare organization, or part of the critical supply chain that supports one. \"The delivery of health care from drugs, lab work to medical equipment such as N-95 masks or Brew Dog's re-tooling to produce a product like a hand sanitizer,\" Thornton-Trump explains, \"involves a multitude of critical supply chain relationships: I fear that the criminals lack the knowledge of how multi-faceted health care delivery is and what organizations deliver the health care services.\"\n\nThornton-Trump has some stark advice for those cyber-criminals: \"shut down operations completely for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, lest you draw the ire of an angry nation with significant cyber capabilities of their own.\"\n\nJake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist at ESET, warns that considering these promises, \"we mustn’t get complacent as there are thousands of threat actors, each with a different level of conscience and ethics.\" Even if these groups that responded, he argues, can be trusted, \"that doesn't mean the health sector should take their eye off the ball for any moment. Don't forget that WannaCry crippled the NHS without any thought of the impact on the country and cost to the industry.\" And WannaCry wasn't even targeting healthcare; the NHS was just collateral damage.",

                        "docText": "The findings of a three-month Freedom of Information (FOI) campaign, which surveyed more than 150 NHS trusts in the U.K., has found that many are not investing in cybersecurity training.\n\nConducted by security company Redscan, the investigation found that NHS trusts spent an average of just over £5,350 on data security training, although a significant proportion conducted such training in-house at no cost or only used free NHS Digital training tools. Spending on training varied significantly between trusts, from £238 to £78,000. Interestingly, the size of each trust was not always a determining factor in the amount spent, for example, mid-sized trusts with 3000-4000 employees ranged from £500 to £33,000.\n\nThe FOI findings also found that NHS trusts were falling short when it came to meeting targets. NHS Digital’s mandatory information governance (IG) training requirements state that 95% of all staff must pass IG training every 12 months. The FOI campaign found, currently, only 12% of trusts had met the training target. Further to this, a quarter of trusts had trained less than 80% of their staff (some reporting that less than 50% had been trained).\n\n“These findings shine a light on the cybersecurity failings of the NHS, which is struggling to implement a cohesive security strategy under difficult circumstances,” explained Mark Nicholls, director of cybersecurity at Redscan. “Individual trusts lack in-house cybersecurity talent and many are falling short of training targets; while investment in security and data protection training is patchy at best.\"\n\nThe campaign also found that on average, NHS trusts employ only one qualified security professional per 2,582 employees. Nearly a quarter of trusts have no employees with security qualifications (24 out of 108 trusts), despite some employing as many as 16,000 full and part-time personnel.\n\nNicholls had some theories on why this is: “The cybersecurity skills gap continues to grow and it’s incredibly hard for organisations across all sectors to find enough people with the right knowledge and experience.\n\n\"It’s even tougher for the NHS, which must compete with the private sector’s bumper wages. Not to mention the fact that trusts outside of traditional tech hubs like London and Cambridge have a smaller talent pool from which to choose from.”\n\nThe company noted that NHS employees are trained at different intervals throughout the year, and trusts do not have to maintain their 95% target for the full year.\n\nHowever, following the disaster of the WannaCry attack in May 2017, costing £92m, it is shocking to see that so many trusts are falling short of the mark when it comes to cybersecurity.",

He is standing by that and he fights the charges and we intend to fight the case in Wisconsin.\"\n\nShe described the federal indictment against him as \"pretty flimsy, it's pretty slim compared to what we normally see in a United States indictment.\"\n\nProsecutors told a Las Vegas court on Friday that Mr Hutchins had been caught in a sting operation when undercover officers bought the code.\n\nThey claimed the software was sold for $2,000 in digital currency in June 2015.\n\nDan Cowhig, prosecuting, also told the court that Mr Hutchins had made a confession during a police interview.\n\n\"He admitted he was the author of the code of Kronos malware and indicated he sold it,\" said Mr Cowhig.\n\nThe lawyer claimed there was evidence of chat logs between Mr Hutchins and an unnamed co-defendant - who has yet to be arrested - where the security researcher complained of not receiving a fair share of the money.\n\nAt the scene\n\nBy James Cook, BBC North America correspondent\n\nThere was no missing Marcus Hutchins as he was brought into courtroom 3C of the US District Court in Las Vegas.\n\nThe \"surfer who saved the world\" was wearing a bright yellow custody-issue T-shirt and trousers along with luminous orange socks and sandals.\n\nJudge Nancy Kobbe was sympathetic to the defendant's plea to be released on bail, waving away a claim from a government lawyer that the cyber-security expert posed a risk to the public because he had gone shooting on a gun range popular with tourists.\n\nMr Hutchins was so softly spoken that several times Ms Kobbe had to ask him to raise his voice.\n\nMs Lobo said Mr Hutchins denied he was the author of the malware and said he would plead not guilty to all of the charges, which date between July 2014 and July 2015.\n\n\"He has dedicated his life to researching malware, not trying to harm people,\" she said. \"Use the internet for good is what he has done.\n\n\"He was completely shocked, this isn't' something he anticipated. He came here for a work-related conference and he was fully anticipating to go back home and had no reason to be fearful of coming or going from the United States.\"\n\nMr Hutchins came to prominence in May this year after finding a \"kill switch\" to stop the WannaCry ransomeware attack that hit the NHS, as well as other organisations in 150 countries.\n\nAlso known as \"MalwareTech\" online, Mr Hutchins was hailed as an \"accidental hero\" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.\n\nMr Hutchins, who works for Los Angeles-based computer security firm Kryptos Logi, had been in Las Vegas to attend the Black Hat and Def Con cyber-security conferences.\n\nHe was arrested at Las Vegas airport minutes before he was due to fly home.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?\n\nDistrict judge Nancy Koppe, who was presented letters of support from Mr Hutchins' cyber-security colleagues, ordered his release on bail as he had no criminal history and because the allegations dated back two years.\n\nHowever, friends and family were unable to raise the bond money before the court closed on Friday, so he will not be released until Monday.\n\nThe conditions of his bail include him not being allowed to access the internet and to stay in Clark County, Nevada, and within the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where he will appear in court on Tuesday.\n\nHe must also be monitored by GPS and surrender his passport.\n\nWhat is Kronos?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nKronos is a type of malware known as a Trojan, meaning it disguises itself as legitimate software. It is thought to be named after a mythological creature.\n\nKronos first came to light in July 2014, when it was advertised on a Russian underground forum for $7,000 (£5,330) - a relatively high figure at the time.\n\nIt was marketed as way to steal logins for banking websites and other financial data.\n\nIts vendor boasted it could evade existing anti-virus software and said it worked with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome web browsers. In an unusual step, the developer promised free upgrades and bug fixes and the option of a $1,000 one week trial.\n\nAfter much publicity it faded from view until October 2015, when IBM researchers reported that Kronos had been spotted in attacks on UK and Indian bank websites.\n\nKronos then struck again in Canada in May 2016, and in November reports surfaced that it had been spotted being distributed via emails.\n\nIT security consultant Robin Edgar said Mr Hutchins' own code had been incorporated into the malware, but he had not done anything wrong.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Mr Hutchins posted a tweet saying, 'look, this Kronos thing has taken my code, stolen my code and used it in it'.\n\n\"He was very unhappy his code had been stolen and used within Kronos. He didn't write Kronos, it looks like, but he wrote a little piece of code which was used in the malware.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption IT professor: Proving code ownership a 'fundamental challenge'\n\nMr Hutchins' local MP in North Devon, Peter Heaton-Jones, said he shared the \"shock\" of the local community over the charges.\n\nThe Conservative politician has written to Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan to seek assurance that Mr Hutchins is receiving adequate consular assistance.\n\nWhilst Mr Heaton-Jones acknowledged the UK cannot interfere with court proceedings in the US and said he has made no judgement about his constituent, adding: \"People who know him in Ilfracombe, and in the wider cyber-community, are astounded at the allegations against him.\n\n\"This is particularly so given his role in helping to protect the NHS and many other institutions from what could have been a devastating cyber-attack just a few months ago.\n\n\"I will continue to monitor his case carefully and to seek the necessary assurances from the government that the UK is doing everything in its power to assist Marcus and his family at this very difficult time.\"\n\nDigital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was \"deeply concerned\" with his arrest, whilst Naomi Colvin, from civil liberties campaign group Courage, said Mr Hutchins \"did the world an enormous service\" when he stopped the WannaCry attack.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning",

                        "docText": "Ransomware Concept getty\n\nRansomware is on a rampage targeting industry and organizations. It is also and creating significant cybersecurity challenges. Ransomware is a type of malware cyber-attack where key files are encrypted encryption by hackers that renders data inaccessible to the victim. It is a criminal extortion tool and after an attack has occurred, the hackers will promise to restore systems and data when ransom is paid by the victims.\n\nThe use of ransomware by hackers to leverage exploits and extract financial benefits is not new. Ransomware has been around for over 2 decades, (early use of basic ransomware malware was used in the late 1980s) but as of late, it has become a trending and more dangerous cybersecurity threat. The inter-connectivity of digital commerce and expanding attack surfaces have enhanced the utility of ransomware as cyber weapon of choice for bad actors. Like bank robbers, cybercriminals go where the money is accessible. And it is now easier for them to reap benefits from extortion. Hackers can now demand cryptocurrencies payments or pre-paid cards that can be anonymously transacted. Those means of digital payments are difficult to trace by law enforcement.\n\nBut it is not just the financial gains, while hackers can use ransomware to extort, it can also be employed to harass and demonstrate vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure. In this sense, state actors and/or criminal gangs can use ransomware as an instrument of geo-political power. Hackers often operate in tacit support by nation state actors and criminal enterprises acting in cahoots. The use of ransomware against critical infrastructures has certainly elevated the issue to global national security levels.\n\nThe Targets (and Costs) of Ransomware Attacks:\n\ncompany network being hacked with ransomware. Hardware and cyber crime concept. 3D illustration. getty\n\nThe current state of cyber-affairs is an especially alarming one because ransomware attacks are growing not only in numbers, but also in the financial and reputational costs to businesses and organizations. Three statistics stand out that highlight ransomware trends and implications:\n\n1) a recent report from Trend Micro has found that 84% of US organizations have reported phishing or ransomware security incidents in the last 12 months. 84% of Organizations Experienced Phishing & Ransomware Type Threats in the Past 12 Months (yahoo.com)\n\n2) according to a report from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 security consulting group, the average ransomware payment climbed 82% to a record $570,000 in the first half of 2021 from $312,000 in 2020. Ransomware criminals' demands rise as aggressive tactics pay off | Fox Business\n\n3) and as a harbinger of things to come, the firm Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that Ransomware Costs Expected to Reach $265 Billion by 2031. The Cybersecurity Ventures analysis predicts that there will be a new attack every 2 seconds as ransomware perpetrators progressively refine their malware payloads and related extortion activities. Global Ransomware Damage Costs Predicted To Exceed $265 Billion By 2031 (cybersecurityventures.com)\n\nIn many cases a ransomware hack can cripple a company’s systems and networks and cause panic and confusion. Companies and organizations who depend on logistics planning and supply chain coordination to operate are particularly at risk. Ransomware malware is designed so it can rapidly spread across a company’s or organization’s computers and networks. Success for hackers does not always depend on using the newest and most sophisticated malware. It is easy for a hacker to do. In most cases, they rely on the most opportune target of vulnerability, especially with the ease of online attacks. Hackers have a large library of malware to choose from as it is estimated that there over 120 separate families of ransomware.\n\nA Short Summary of Ransomware Attacks:\n\nWannaCry ransomware attack getty\n\nIn 2013, hackers used a ransomware called CryptoLocker that required victims to pay funds to recover their vital files. Four year later in 2017, the use of ransomware heightened with an attack called WannaCry. The worldwide WannaCry attack in 2017 was viewed by many (especially in the media) as a wake-up call to the disruptive implications of ransomware. The WannaCry ransomware was self-replicating and spread swiftly reaching over one hundred countries. In various countries, many industries, organizations, and government agencies were victimized. The ransomware disrupted hospital, schools, organizational and company networks that were not well protected and up to date. Those industries were low hanging fruit for hackers. The attacks did not turn out to be as lethal as originally feared, but it certainly demonstrated the global vulnerabilities associated with inter-connected networks and devices.\n\nDespite CryptoLocker, WhiteRose, WannaCry, Petya, and many other high-profile ransomware attacks, the wake-up call was not heeded. Industry, organizations, and governments did little to fortify and defend against such attacks. Earlier this year, the Darkside ransomware gang breached the Colonial Pipeline shutting down their 5,500-mile natural gas pipeline for a week. As a result, gas stations across the Eastern coast of the United States ran out of gas and many services and product supply lines were disrupted.\n\nIn July, a ransomware attack by the Revil criminal ransomware-as-a-service gang infected an estimated 1,500 businesses with ransomware. the attackers found a vulnerability that they exploited in the update mechanism used by the IT services company Kaseya VSA. REvil, a decryption key to those hit by the attack in return for a $70 million payment. Also this Summer, hackers targeted and disrupted operations at JBS, the world’s largest meat supplier.\n\nDuring the past couple of years, healthcare and hospitals were targeted by ransomware attacks. In October 2020, the University of Vermont Health Network was hit by a ransomware attack and their systems couldn’t access electronic health records for nearly a month. It was determined that every computer at UVM Medical Center was found to be infected with malware. The pandemic revealed the health risks of hospital ransomware attacks - The Verge\n\nMany hospitals (like UVM) were vulnerable because they tended to have poor cybersecurity and use many networks and devices that allow for a bigger attack surface. Hackers took advantage over stressed conditions caused Covid 19 to escalate ransomware attacks. Because vital medical facilities cannot afford to shut down, they often comply with ransomware demands to maintain operations.\n\nUnfortunately, for hackers’ soft targets are plentiful, especially in the healthcare, financial, and manufacturing industries, and we can expect to see more such attacks because the vulnerabilities to many networks remain open and accessible to hackers.\n\nAnd as they continue to receive payments from victims, hackers have become even more aggressive in their illicit activities. A recent study by Accenture highlighted how Ransomware actors are growing bolder and sophisticated in their attacks on OT and IT environments. The report noted that criminal gangs cooperate and share commercial hacking tools (such as the pirated Cobalt Strike malware) via the Dark Web. Their targets include critical infrastructure sectors, including manufacturing, financial, energy, and agriculture. The study also says that hackers are using more aggressive high-pressure tactics to escalate infection consequences and that often they deploy multiple pressure points at once to extract ransom payments. In some cases, they are also using double and triple extortion threats. Ransomware attackers are growing bolder and using new extortion methods - TechRepublic\n\nThe U.S. Government Response to Ransomware\n\ndetail of an american government pin. E Pluribus Unum. getty\n\nThe national security importance regarding ransomware attacks is evident in recent policy proclamations by the White House and other government agencies. In June, Anne Neuberger, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, published an open letter to business leaders about the significant threat of ransomware attacks. The letter urged companies to take the threat of ransomware seriously and adopt cybersecurity practices that match this threat. It said: “The private sector also has a critical responsibility to protect against these threats. All organizations must recognize that no company is safe from being targeted by ransomware, regardless of size or location. But there are immediate steps you can take to protect yourself, as well as your customers and the broader economy. Much as our homes have locks and alarm systems and our office buildings have guards and security to meet the threat of theft, we urge you to take ransomware crime seriously and ensure your corporate cyber defenses match the threat.” The open letter set excellent guidelines and provided sound advice on bolstering defenses against ransomware. Memo-What-We-Urge-You-To-Do-To-Protect-Against-The-Threat-of-Ransomware.pdf (whitehouse.gov)\n\nAlso, the U.S. government is also focusing on ransomware as a law enforcement issue. A new Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force was created several months ago by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to help track cyberattacks and digital extortion schemes and combat them. Department Of Justice Creates New Task Force To Take On Ransomware Attacks (forbes.com)\n\nPreventive Actions to Help Mitigate Ransomware Attacks:\n\nRansomware Cloud painted with chalk on blackboard. getty\n\nWhile it is true that anyone and everyone is vulnerable to ransomware attacks, there are available protections and defenses for helping mitigate those threats. It starts with have a risk management strategy and being proactive. First (and foremost) patching and updating of software vulnerabilities must be current. Unfortunately, many companies and organizations are slow, and in many cases, negligent on the update of patches that would prevent breaches.\n\nAlso, some basic precautions can help address threats, these include training employees to recognize malware and phishing threats, disabling macro scripts, cloaking data, and keeping systems and applications updated. Identity management policies and software are also practical tools to employ. If you end up victimized by a breach, be sure to have an incident response plan in place. That plan should also include potentially contacting law enforcement to assist in recovering files and investigating who is doing the hacking.\n\nCyber-hygiene is another important element for combatting ransomware. Phishing is a preferred method for hackers and simple advice is to not click on files that you do not know. Because of hacker tools that employ automated phishes and quality graphics that can mimic banks and businesses, pay careful attention to the URLs of websites to make sure they are legitimate and not spoofs. Especially watch for spam fake job offers, invoices for items you did not order, and messages from your company that seem out of place. Also, you should make it a habit to verify email senders are who they say they are and exercise caution when opening any email attachments.\n\nCheck your permissions on your apps to see what data they are accessing. If it is not something you authorized, be sure to revoke those access rights and to clean out your cookies.\n\nCompanies and individuals should employ anti-malware & anti-ransomware platforms, and technologies to guard your devices such as multi-factor authentication, firewalls, and email filters. Emerging technologies such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) offer software tools that can detect anomalies, provide user behavioral analytics, and help mitigate threats. ML and AI are viable options for companies to consider for fortifying their security.\n\nEveryone online, companies and consumers, should follow the important rule of backing up important or sensitive files! Proper backup procedures cost little in expense and time and can be an insurance policy for maintain company operations flowing in the case of a breach.\n\nIf you are a small or medium company that lacks resources, Managed Security Services (MSS) and Managed Service Providers (MSP) are options to consider using for both prevention and incident response. Many firms can monitor networks, provide enabling cybersecurity technologies, and threat assessments. MSS makes economic sense for many industries and businesses, which do not have (or can afford) the internal subject matter expertise or capabilities to handle increasingly sophisticated breaches. Paradoxically, some of MSS and MSPs have themselves been targeted by ransomware attacks. But in today’s world, everyone is a target.\n\nRisk Management Resources for Ransomware:\n\nrisk management concept hand drawn on chalkboard getty\n\nThe White House Open letter open letter set excellent guidelines and provided sound advice on bolstering defenses against ransomware. Below are additional useful government resources from DHS/CISA, NIST and others to learn more about ransomware threats, risk management, and how to build a more resilient security posture.\n\nUnited States Government Launches First One-Stop Ransomware Resource at StopRansomware.gov | Homeland Security (dhs.gov)\n\nProtecting Sensitive and Personal Information from Ransomware-Caused Data Breaches (cisa.gov)\n\n\n\n\n\nCSRC | NIST Ransomware Protection and Response | CSRC | CSRC\n\nNIST NIST Releases Tips and Tactics for Dealing With Ransomware\n\nPadlock with ransomware virus text getty\n\nThe sobering reality is that ransomware is on a rampage. Ransomware will continue to be a destructive threat because there are so many available soft targets. We live in an increasingly hyper-connected world that impacts all aspects of our lives. From now and onward, managing and protecting data will be a security imperative for every industry and organization.\n\nAwareness and understanding the ransomware threat can help address many of the cybersecurity challenges. Emerging cybersecurity technologies, mitigation tools, and protocols can help limit the exploding trend of ransomware attacks. Taking pro-active measures to protect systems, networks, and devices, and be more resilient, need to be part of a new wake-up call.\n\n# # #\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Brooks, President of Brooks Consulting International, is a globally recognized thought leader and subject matter expert Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies.

The country was previously accused in the summer of trying to steal vaccine secrets.\n\nHackers connected to Beijing are widely believed to be involved in trying to take the work of western scientists, although Chichester said “the ultimate decision to call a country out rests with the Foreign Office” and that “we have made a conscious decision to call out the Russian attacks”.\n\nCriminal groups meanwhile posed as PPE suppliers, offering to supply equipment to NHS organisations in the hope of persuading a busy purchaser to hand over money to a company that did not exist, NCSC officials added.\n\nA newly created service where anybody could report a suspicious email to NCSC at report@phishing.gov.uk was inundated with 2.3m emails, which led, the agency said, to 22,000 internet sites being taken offline.\n\nThe pandemic threat also meant that the NCSC found itself engaged with unexpected businesses, including the supermarkets, whose supply chain systems were identified as part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure when the crisis first emerged in the spring.\n\nTaken together the extra threat posed by state and criminal hackers meant that NCSC dealt with 10% more incidents in the year to 31 August, a total of 723, the highest level since the organisation was first formed in 2016.\n\nThere were around 1,200 victims, up by a third, reflecting the fact that the most serious attacks targeted multiple actors. “The second half of the year was massively dominated by Covid,” said Lindy Cameron, NCSC’s chief executive.\n\nBoth public and private sector organisations can call in NCSC to deal with a serious cyber-attack, and in a crisis a squad of cyber-experts can be deployed alongside the company or unit’s IT department to tackle the threat.\n\nRansomware incidents – where a hacker disables an IT system or steals sensitive data and demands a payment for restoring or returning it - rose threefold in the past year, and the tactics of criminals have also changed.\n\n“Rather than simply preventing access to data, criminals are stealing it and threatening to leak the most sensitive parts publicly,” NCSC’s annual report said, echoing “hack and leak” attacks used by Russian actors to influence the 2016 US election with the targeting of Democratic party emails.\n\nTargets during the past year included an unnamed “English football league club” which suffered a “crippling attack” on its corporate and security systems, which prevented its CCTV and turnstiles from working and almost led to a fixture being called off at short notice.",

WannaCry presented the possibility that the North also wanted to sow chaos.\n\nThe complaint was the most specific public accounting yet of North Korea's cyber attacks against other countries. The Justice Department has now brought charges against state actors from North Korea, China, Iran and Russia, the United States' most formidable cyberfoes.\n\nThe complaints and indictments have been seen as a key tool in deterring attacks; the Trump administration also imposed sanctions on Park. But as officials tried to convey that North Korea would pay a high price for hacking US targets, President Donald Trump undercut their effort with a friendly tweet about the North Korean leader, Mr Kim Jong Un, hours before the complaint was announced.\n\nMr Trump wrote that Mr Kim, whom he has sought to engage on nuclear talks, \"proclaims 'unwavering faith in President Trump'. Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!\" It was unclear whether Mr Trump knew about the forthcoming complaint.

It made no mention of the US-led attacks on North Korea's missile programme, ordered by president Barack Obama months before the Sony attack. And it omitted the source of some of the weapons in the WannaCry attack, which were leaked or stolen from the US National Security Agency, though the US has not publicly conceded that.\n\nCyber attacks have not been a topic of the recent negotiations with North Korea.\n\n\"The North Korean government, through a state-sponsored group, robbed a central bank and citizens of other nations, retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away, and created disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries, causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars' worth of damage,\" said Mr John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division.\n\n\"These charges will send a message that we will track down malicious actors no matter how or where they hide,\" he added.

As the U.S. announced its case against the North Koreans, the government was still grappling with hacks by Russia of federal agencies and private corporations that officials say was aimed at information-gathering.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“What we see emerging uniquely out of North Korea is trying to raise funds through illegal cyber activities,” including the theft of traditional currency and cryptocurrency, as well as cyber extortion schemes, said Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department’s top national security official.\n\nBecause of North Korea’s economic system and sanctions imposed on the country, he added, “They use their cyber capabilities to try to get currency wherever they can do that, and that’s not something that we really see from actors in China or Russia or in Iran.”\n\nNone of the three defendants is in American custody, and though officials don’t expect them to travel to the U.S. anytime soon for prosecution, Justice Department officials in recent years have found value in indicting foreign government hackers — even in absentia — as a message that they are not anonymous and can be identified and implicated in crimes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, prosecutors unsealed a plea deal with a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen who investigators say organized the sophisticated laundering of millions of dollars in stolen funds. Ghaleb Alaumary, 37, of Ontario, Canada,agreed to plead guilty in Los Angeles to organizing teams of co-conspirators in the U.S. and Canada to launder funds obtained through various schemes.\n\nThe indictment unsealed Wednesday charges Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il and Park Jin Hyok with crimes including conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud. Park was previously charged in 2018 in a criminal complaint linking him to the hacking team responsible for the hack of Sony Pictures and the WannaCry global ransomware attack, among other acts.\n\nBesides naming two additional defendants beyond the original case, the new indictment also adds to the list of victims from around the world of hacks carried out by the Reconnaissance General Bureau.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe indictment accuses the hackers of participating in a conspiracy that attempted to steal more than $1.3 billion of money and cryptocurrency from banks and businesses, unleashed a sweeping ransomware campaign and targeted Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 in retaliation for a Hollywood movie, “The Interview,” that the North Korean government didn’t like because it depicted a fictionalized assassination of leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe indictment says the hackers engaged not just in cybertheft but also in “revenge-motivated computer attacks, at times executing commands “to destroy computer systems, deploy ransomware” or otherwise render victims’ computers inoperable.\n\n“The scope of these crimes by the North Korean hackers is staggering,” said Tracy Wilkison, the acting U.S. Attorney in the Central District of California, where Sony Pictures is located and where the indictment was filed. “They are the crimes of a nation-state that has stopped at nothing to extract revenge and to obtain money to prop up its regime.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilkison would not say how much money the hackers actually received. But the indictment does charge them in connection with a theft from Bangladesh’s central bank in 2016 involving wire transfers “totaling approximately $81 million to bank accounts in the Philippines and $20 million to a bank account in Sri Lanka,” and with multiple other multi-million-dollar ATM cashouts and cyber extortion schemes.\n\nAll told, the conspirators “attempted to steal or extort more than $1.3 billion,” according to the indictment.\n\nTo empty the cryptocurrency accounts of victims, the cyberthieves seeded malware posing as cryptocurrency-trading software on legitimate-seeming websites to trick victims, according to an alert published by the FBI and other U.S. agencies. Once infected, a victim’s computer could be entered and controlled by remote access. Later, hackers used other techniques including phishing and social engineering to infect victims’ computers.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Frank Bajak in Boston contributed to this report.",

Trump focused his recent summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on eliminating the regime’s nuclear weapons. But experts say he missed an opportunity to press North Korea on another pressing threat: its long record of dangerous cyberattacks against commercial and military targets in the U.S. and allied nations. (Susan Walsh,Pool/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON — Among the subjects President Donald Trump apparently didn’t discuss with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore — the regime’s human rights abuses, its exports of missile technology and its mistreatment of U.S. prisoners — there’s one more: its long record of dangerous cyberattacks against sensitive targets in the U.S. and allied nations.\n\nExperts warn that the country’s hacking skills have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous in recent years. North Korean exploits have included the damaging 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks, intrusions into banks in more than a dozen countries to heist millions of dollars over the last few years, and continually brazen cyberattacks on South Korean computer networks.\n\nThe historic Singapore meeting focused on “denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula, although it didn’t yield a detailed agreement for accomplishing that goal.\n\nIn the run-up to the June 12 meeting, the Department of Homeland Security warned of an ongoing threat by North Korean government hackers, who have attacked critical infrastructure and media, aerospace and financial companies since at least 2009, infecting networks in at least 17 countries and the United States. Days after the summit, DHS sent a fresh notice describing malware variants used by North Korea.\n\nBut there is no indication that the two leaders discussed cybersecurity, worrying experts who warn that North Korea’s cyberwarfare capabilities pose an immediate threat to U.S. interests that warrants high-level attention.\n\nFew know the impact of a North Korean cyberattack like former Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton. More than three years ago, the American movie studio owned of Sony suffered a crippling hack prior to its release of “The Interview,” a film centered on a screwball satire of Kim.\n\nThe unprecedented corporate cyberattack cost Sony more than $100 million — destroying more than 70 percent of the computers at the then-7,000-person studio, Lynton told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday. It took the company roughly a year to recover. Lynton left Sony in 2017 to become chairman of Snap Inc.\n\n“Denuclearization is great, but we also have to concern ourselves with what the cyber capabilities are, so we can make sure that doesn’t happen to our businesses and other assets in the United States,” Lynton said.\n\nThe Associated Press made efforts to determine whether the subject came up in Singapore, but the White House declined official comment for this story. The subject wasn’t mentioned in official statements out of the summit or by the president in his post-summit press conference .\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Inc., said North Korea’s recently cyberactivities have focused on “traditional espionage” aimed at gathering intelligence from nations involved in the summit, as well as destructive attacks and cybercrime to raise money for the regime.\n\nNorth Korea has slowly joined the small group of nations, along with China and Russia, with both the hacking mojo and a proven willingness to attack U.S. interests. Following the attack on Sony, the FBI publicly blamed North Korea, the first time it had done so. The Obama administration imposed sanctions as a result.\n\nAn Obama-era agreement with China aimed at curbing economic cyberespionage was reaffirmed by the Trump Administration last year. But earlier this year, Trump accused China of continuing to conduct and support cyber intrusions into U.S. computer networks “to gain access to valuable business information so Chinese companies can copy products,” costing the economy “hundreds of billions of dollars” annually.\n\nDHS officials have carried on with their cybersecurity mission outside of the main focus of the Trump-related political sphere, often out of public view. But the results of that China-U.S. pact have left many a little jaded about the efficacy of diplomacy on this issue.\n\nTrump’s cybersecurity efforts have been largely overshadowed by immigration, health care and ongoing investigations. Still, last year the Justice Department announced sanctions and criminal indictments against an Iranian state-sponsored hacker network that had targeted hundreds of U.S. and foreign universities, U.S. companies and government agencies, and the United Nations.\n\nThe Trump presidential campaign has also benefited from embarrassing disclosures in hacked emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s campaign staff and others. Trump also openly invited Russian hackers to find and release tens of thousands of personal emails that Clinton had deleted from the private server she had used to conduct government business as secretary of state.\n\n___\n\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They also hacked crypto exchanges, and creating a destructive ransomware virus, WannaCry, in May 2017, prosecutors said.\n\nAD\n\nThey targeted cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing $75 million from a Slovenian company in 2017, $25 million from an Indonesian company in 2018 and $11.8 million from a bank in New York in August in which the hackers used the CryptoNeuro Trader application as a backdoor, prosecutors alleged.\n\nAD\n\nThey also conducted “spear-phishing” campaigns targeting U.S. defense contractors and energy, aerospace and technology companies, as well as the State Department and Pentagon, to trick employees into giving up credential enabling the hackers’ entry into their computers.\n\nThe $1.3 billion allegedly targeted would represent almost half of the total amount of North Korea’s civilian merchandise imports — mainly from China — in 2019, the most recent year for which estimates are available, said Nicholas Eberhardt an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. “So it’s a huge big deal for the North Korean economy,” he said.",

The Treasury Department said all three are controlled by North Korea’s primary intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).\n\nAD\n\nThe Treasury Department said the North Korean hackers had targeted governments, the military, financial institutions, entertainment and manufacturing companies, international shipping companies and critical infrastructure.\n\nAD\n\nSecurity experts believe the Lazarus Group stepped up its activity after U.N. sanctions were imposed on North Korea over its nuclear program, effectively starving the government of revenue.\n\nThe Trump administration has been pushing to tighten the vise, lobbying other countries to enforce sanctions to the hilt and downgrade their diplomatic relations and economic trade.\n\nNorth Korea has denied allegations of orchestrating cyberattacks and cyberheists. Meanwhile, tensions have been rising over North Korea’s missile threat and U.S. moves to isolate the regime. Pyongyang has pledged to never give up its nuclear weapons, which the United States and its allies say must be the goal of any negotiations.\n\nAD\n\nNorth Korea on Monday launched two short-range projectiles off its east coast in the country’s first weapons test in three months, one year after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s failed summit meeting with President Trump and amid allegations that nuclear talks have broken down.\n\nAD\n\nNorth Korea had held off weapons tests since it last launched two rockets from its east coast on Nov. 28. However Kim announced at a ruling party meeting at the end of December that he no longer felt bound by a self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, warning the world would soon see a “new strategic weapon” as his country continued to bolster its nuclear deterrent.\n\nKim complained that despite his hopes for diplomacy, the United States had responded to the moratorium by continuing to conduct military drills with South Korea, breaking a promise given by Trump.\n\nAD\n\nIt had also shipped advanced military equipment to South Korea and imposed new sanctions on the North, he said, complaining of a “hostile” policy and “gangster-like acts.”\n\nState-run media on Friday reported Kim appeared in public to inspect a drill of units of the North Korean People’s Army that coincided with the anniversary of Kim’s summit last year with President Trump in Hanoi.\n\nAD\n\nIts weapons test came days after the United States and South Korea postponed their joint annual military drills, originally scheduled for this month because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDespite sanctions intended to cut off North Korea from the global financial system, Pyongyang has used “deceptive practices” to exploit enforcement deficiencies and maintain access through networks and bank representatives worldwide, the U.N. panel said.\n\nAD\n\nThe panel said North Korean financial institutions, including banks under U.N. sanctions, “maintain more than 30 overseas representatives controlling bank accounts and facilitating transactions, including for illicit transfers of coal and petroleum.”\n\nThe panel said the banks and their representatives “make use of complicit foreign nationals to obfuscate their activities.”\n\nAD",

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nA slew of Democratic senators are calling for tougher privacy laws — and even steep fines for companies that fail to protect their customers’ data from data breaches — in the wake of Marriott’s admission that hackers compromised the personal information of up to 500 million of its customers.\n\n“We must set clear customer data protection standards for all companies — whether they’re hotel chains, online retailers, or big tech — and severe penalties for those who fall short,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) tweeted.\n\nSens. Mark Warner (Va.) and Ed Markey (Mass.) also pressed for tougher data security laws, and said Congress needs to set limits on how much customer data U.S. companies are allowed to store. Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) went even further — he said senior executives who ignore customer data privacy should face jail time.\n\nAfter potentially one of the largest breaches of consumer data in history, lawmakers appear ready to take a page out of Europe’s playbook to ensure it does not happen again: Their calls for aggressive penalties for companies that have poor data security are reminiscent of the General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect in the European Union earlier this year. The GDPR requires companies to adhere to a highly specific set of security requirements — and contains fines up to 4 percent of a company's annual revenue for violations. It is unclear, however, how such legislation would fare in a split Congress that appears poised for gridlock.\n\nWyden outlined on Twitter specific legislation that would impose “harsh fines and prison terms” for companies that misuse consumer data. The bill, which a spokesman said he is preparing to introduce early next year, would set up a new office with the Federal Trade Commission called the Bureau of Technology, give it sweeping powers to punish businesses for lax data security practices, and require it to hire 175 staffers to “police the largely unregulated market for private data.”\n\nThe bill would also introduce a new set of data security requirements, set up a “do not track” list for individual consumers to opt out of data collection online, and outlines “steep fines (up to 4 percent of annual revenue), on the first offense for companies and 10-20 year criminal penalties for senior executives,” according to a release from Wyden's office.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren also said there should be consequences for executives, tweeting, “CEOs won't take protecting our data seriously unless their own jobs are on the line.”\n\nTo address the current crisis, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday that Marriott that should pay for new passports for customers whose passport numbers were stolen.\n\nMarriott, for its part, seemed to admit a degree of culpability for the breach of its Starwood reservation system containing addresses, travel locations, credit card numbers, phone numbers, passport numbers. The breach could possibly leave droves of customers vulnerable to espionage or identity theft.\n\n“We fell short of what our guests deserve and what we expect of ourselves,” Marriott president and chief executive Arne Sorenson said in a release. “We are doing everything we can to support our guests, and using lessons learned to be better moving forward.”\n\nBut this apology was not sufficient for lawmakers, who insisted that businesses like Marriott can no longer be trusted to police themselves when it comes to data security.\n\n“It seems like every other day we learn about a new mega-breach affecting the personal data of millions of Americans,” Warner said in a statement. “Rather than accepting this trend as normal, this latest incident should strengthen Congress’ resolve.”\n\n“If history is any guide, Marriott’s mega data breach will be treated like all the others: the company will apologize and offer useless credit monitoring to the victims impacted,” Wyden tweeted. “The status quo isn’t working.” There have been several major breaches in the last several years that put hundreds of millions of customers’ personal information at risk: The breaches of Target and Yahoo in 2013; Home Depot in 2014; the health insurer Anthem in 2015; and credit reporting company Equifax last year.\n\nBut as of now, U.S. companies rarely face fines for breaches. The last major U.S. corporate cybersecurity overhaul was the 2014 Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, which led to a voluntary set of standards managed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). That law doesn't include fines for violations or data breaches.\n\nRon Gula, a cybersecurity investor who founded Maryland-based cybersecurity company Tenable Network Security, said Warner and Markey's idea that setting limits on personal information that companies can store would not be realistic for companies like Marriott, though he noted penalties might help improve their attitudes toward security.\n\n“When you book a Marriott hotel room it’s kind of nice that they already have all of your information when you book a room … they are always going to have to collect sensitive data on their customers,” Gula said. “So the only other option is to increase their cybersecurity. The only other thing you can do is just increase penalties.”\n\nOthers were skeptical that penalties would do anything to address the broader issue. As soon as there's a security mandate, some experts worried companies would focus on meeting the bare minimum that's required of them to avoid the fine.\n\nBusinesses “must demonstrate that they are investing in security, not just to meet the minimum threshold of what the law requires — but that protecting their customers is a pillar of their business,” Ellison Anne Williams, a former NSA technologist who is chief executive of a Maryland-based encryption company called EnVeil, told me in an email.\n\nSign Up!

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nPINGED: Facebook has said it never sold users' data, but internal communications seem to paint a more complicated picture. “Facebook executives in recent years appeared to discuss giving access to their valuable user data to some companies that bought advertising when it was struggling to launch its mobile-ad business, according to internal emails quoted in newly unredacted court filings,” The Washington Post's Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg reported. “In an ongoing federal court case against Facebook, the plaintiffs claim that the social media giant doled out people’s data secretly and selectively in exchange for advertising purchases or other concessions, even as others were cut off, ruining their businesses. The case was brought by one such company, Six4Three, which claims its business was destroyed in 2015 by Facebook’s actions.”\n\nMany companies that relied on Facebook's data via an application programming interface, or API, folded after the tech giant in 2014 “announced it was restricting developers' access to the API, citing privacy concerns from users who complained that their data was being shared with outsiders without their knowledge,” according to my colleagues. But Six4Three is challenging's Facebook's explanation. “Six4Three alleges that privacy was not the reason Facebook shut down the API,” Elizabeth and Craig wrote. “The developer claims Facebook realized that it could use its data feed as leverage, to pressure businesses to buy advertising that would fuel the company’s then-nascent mobile-ad business.”\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on Capitol Hill in Washington on Oct. 6. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nPATCHED: Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) introduced a bill that would create a program at the State Department to share information on election security with U.S. allies, according to a press release from Klobuchar's office. The bill, titled “Global Electoral Exchange Act,” would authorize the department to award grants to American nonprofits that focus on election security in order to share information with similar groups in allied countries. “Our intelligence community continues to warn that our elections—and those of our allies—are a target for adversaries,” Klobuchar said in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will allow the State Department to work with our allies abroad to share information, discuss best practices, and combat the growing threat of election interference to democracies around the world.”\n\nMoreover, under the program, foreigners involved in administering elections would travel to the United States to study U.S. electoral procedures while American officials would have an opportunity to learn about other countries' election security efforts. A similar bipartisan bill sponsored by Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) passed the House in a voice vote in September. “The threats to our democratic electoral process and those of other democracies across the globe should not be taken lightly,” Sullivan said in a statement.\n\nOmar Abdulaziz, a Saudi opposition activist, poses for a portrait in Montreal on Oct. 17. (François Ollivier for The Washington Post)\n\nPWNED: A Saudi critic of the authorities in Riyadh alleges in a lawsuit that the Israeli company NSO Group, which sells the Pegasus spyware, helped Saudi Arabia monitor his communications with Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October, the New York Times's David D. Kirkpatrick reported. “The spyware allows its customers to secretly listen to calls, record keystrokes, read messages, and track internet history on a targeted phone,” according to the Times. “It also enables customers to use a phone’s microphone and camera as surveillance devices. Because of those sweepingly invasive capabilities, Israel classifies the spyware as a weapon. The company must obtain approval from the Defense Ministry for its sale to foreign governments.”\n\nThe Saudi opposition activist, Omar Abdulaziz, has asylum in Canada and lives in Montreal. Abdulaziz and Khashoggi, who was a contributing columnist for The Post, collaborated on dissidence projects, the Times reported. “The lawsuit was filed by an Israeli lawyer, Alaa Mahajna, in cooperation with Mazen Masri, a lecturer at the City University of London,” Kirkpatrick wrote. “The lawyers say in the court papers that they intend to argue that the resulting exposure of the collaboration between Mr. Abdulaziz and Mr. Khashoggi ‘contributed in a significant manner to the decision to murder Mr. Khashoggi.’”\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\n— The United States and China will start negotiations to enact “structural changes” to their trade relations, according to a White House statement.

A cyberattack on the reservation system of Starwood, a Marriott subsidiary, allowed unauthorized access to information about as many as 500 million guests since 2014. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)\n\nU.S. government investigators increasingly believe that Chinese state hackers were most likely responsible for the massive intrusion reported last month into Marriott’s Starwood chain hotel reservation system, a breach that exposed the private information and travel details of as many as 500 million people, according to two people briefed on the government investigation.\n\nThese people cautioned that the investigation has not been completed, so definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. But the sweep and tactics of the hack, which took place over four years before being discovered, prompted immediate speculation that it was carried out by a country.\n\nPreliminary indications are the breach was executed by hackers affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal information not yet ready for public release. The MSS, an intelligence and security agency, has been behind many Chinese government intrusions into sensitive U.S. networks in recent years.\n\nSome U.S. intelligence officials believe that the breach was conducted to enrich the massive Chinese data sets on U.S. and other citizens that have been amassed for years, the people said. Such breaches include the 2015 Office of Personnel Management intrusion, which compromised personal data of more than 20 million government employees, family members and applicants, and also information collected during Chinese breaches of health-care institutions such as Anthem and CareFirst.\n\nThe FBI and other intelligence agencies declined to comment.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that investigators believe the attackers were likely to be the work of a Chinese state intelligence service.\n\nThe Marriott breach exposed an unusually broad array of data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers and credit card numbers, as well as information on where people traveled and with whom.\n\nSuch information would be valuable not just to criminals seeking to commit identity fraud but also intelligence agencies seeking to build dossiers and track movements of diplomats, spies, military personnel, business executives and journalists, according to several cybersecurity experts. Armed with a rich array of personal data, an intelligence agency can also tailor an approach to a person to see whether the individual can be recruited as a spy or blackmailed for information. The passport data, which is not often collected in data breaches, probably was a particularly valuable find for the hackers.\n\nThe people familiar with the investigation said the Marriott breach involved the same cloud-hosting space that Chinese state hackers have used in the past, and that one signature technique that involved hopping among servers also points to Chinese involvement. Another clue suggesting nation-state involvement was that none of the breached data has appeared on the “dark Web” or any of the forums that criminals typically use to sell stolen credentials and other valuable personal data.\n\n\"If it were a criminal act, people would be trying to sell it,” said one of the people familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe breach of the reservation system for Marriott’s Starwood subsidiaries was one of the largest in history, affecting travelers at the hotel chains St. Regis, Westin, Sheraton, Aloft, Le Meridien, Four Points and W from 2014 onward, according to a Marriott news release last month.\n\nMarriott acquired Starwood in 2016 and kept the reservation databases separate from its own until recently. The reservation system of Marriott hotels themselves was not affected by the breach. The Bethesda, Md.-based company has more than 6,700 properties around the world.\n\nAn internal security tool flagged the possible breach on Sept. 8 and later discovered that the hackers had accessed customer information and attempted to remove it in encrypted form, the company said. Marriott was able to decrypt the information and understand the extent of the breach only in November, it said.\n\nMarriott on Tuesday reiterated its previous comment on the data breach, saying in a statement: “Our primary objectives in this investigation are figuring out what occurred and how we can best help our guests. We have no information about the cause of this incident, and we have not speculated about the identity of the attacker.”\n\nChina’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment Wednesday. But a spokesman last week said that “China firmly opposes all forms of cyberattack and cracks down on it in accordance with the law.”\n\n“If offered evidence, the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to the law. We firmly object to making groundless accusations on the issue of cybersecurity,” spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press briefing when asked about the Marriott allegations.\n\nNews of the breach prompted several U.S. government officials to announce investigations, including New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Several members of Congress also publicly demanded answers.\n\nPrivacy advocates long have warned that travel data can provide remarkably precise insights into the lifestyles, tastes and personal relationships of individuals, but the industry has lagged behind others, such as banking, in securing information against hackers.\n\nTaylor Telford and Anna Fifeld in Beijing contributed to this report.",

The information taken may have included names, addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, loyalty information for linked companies like airlines and room preferences. Marriott said it's still investigating but it doesn't believe credit card information, passport numbers or driver's license information was accessed.\n\nMarriott said it noticed an unexpected amount of guest information was accessed at the end of February using the login credentials of two employees at a franchised property.

                        "docText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Security experts alarmed by the scope of a data breach at the Marriott hotel empire worry that stolen information on specific hotel stays could be used for burglary, espionage or reputational attacks.\n\nHackers stole information on as many as 500 million guests of the Marriott hotel empire over four years, obtaining credit card and passport numbers and other personal data, including arrival and departure dates.\n\nThe crisis quickly emerged as one of the biggest data breaches on record. By comparison, last year's Equifax hack affected more than 145 million people. A Target breach in 2013 affected more than 41 million payment card accounts and exposed contact information for more than 60 million customers.\n\nChris Wysopal, chief technology officer with the security firm Veracode, said the attack goes beyond traditional credit-card theft, as information about a person's hotel stay \"could be used to incriminate someone.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesse Varsalone, professor of cybersecurity at the University of Maryland, said hackers' access to the reservation system could be troubling if the hackers turn out to be, say, nation-state spies rather than those out simply for financial gain.\n\nThat information could mean knowing when and where government officials are traveling, such as to military bases or conferences, he said.\n\n\"There are just so many things you can extrapolate from people staying at hotels,\" he said.\n\nAnd because the data included reservations for future stays, along with home addresses, burglars could learn when someone wouldn't be home, said Scott Grissom of LegalShield, a provider of legal services.\n\nThe affected hotel brands were operated by Starwood before it was acquired by Marriott in 2016. They include W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element, Aloft, The Luxury Collection, Le Méridien and Four Points. Starwood-branded timeshare properties were also affected. None of the Marriott-branded chains were threatened.\n\nEmail notifications for those who may have been affected begin rolling out Friday.\n\nThe full scope of the failure was not immediately clear. Marriott was trying to determine if the records included duplicates, such as a single person staying multiple times.\n\nSecurity analysts were especially alarmed to learn that the breach began in 2014. While such failures often span months, four years is extreme, said Yonatan Striem-Amit, chief technology officer of Cybereason.\n\nIt was unclear what hackers could do with the credit card information. Though it was stored in encrypted form, it was possible that hackers also obtained the two components needed to descramble the numbers, the company said.\n\nFor as many as two-thirds of those affected, the exposed data could include mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers. Also included might be dates of birth, gender, reservation dates, arrival and departure times and Starwood Preferred Guest account information.\n\nThe breach of personal information could put Marriott in violation of new European privacy laws, as guests included European travelers.\n\nMarriott set up a website and call center for customers who believe they are at risk.\n\nIt isn't common for passport numbers to be part of a hack, but it has happened before. Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific said in October that 9.4 million passengers' information had been breached, including passport numbers.\n\nPassport numbers are often requested by hotels outside the U.S. because U.S. driver's licenses are not accepted there as identification. The numbers could be added to full sets of data about a person that bad actors sell on the black market, leading to identity theft.\n\nAnd while the credit card industry can cancel accounts and issue new cards within days, it is a much more difficult process, often steeped in government bureaucracy, to get a new passport.\n\nBut one redeeming factor about passports is that they are often required to be seen in person, said Ryan Wilk of NuData Security. \"It's a highly secure document with a lot of security features,\" he said.\n\nWhen the merger was first announced in 2015, Starwood had 21 million people in its loyalty program. The company manages more than 6,700 properties across the globe, most in North America.\n\nWhile the first impulse for those potentially affected by the breach could be to check credit cards, security experts say other information in the database could be more damaging.\n\nThe names, addresses, passport numbers and other personal information \"is of greater concern than the payment info, which was encrypted,\" analyst Ted Rossman of CreditCards.com said, citing the risk that thieves could open fraudulent accounts.\n\nAn internal security tool signaled a potential breach in early September, but the company was unable to decrypt the information that would define what data had possibly been exposed until last week.\n\nMarriott, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a regulatory filing that it was premature to estimate what financial impact the breach will have on the company. It noted that it does have cyber insurance, and is working with its insurance carriers to assess coverage.\n\nElected officials were quick to call for action.\n\nThe New York attorney general opened an investigation. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, co-founder of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, said the U.S. needs laws that limit the data companies can collect on customers and ensure that companies account for security costs rather than making consumers \"shoulder the burden and harms resulting from these lapses.\"\n\n___\n\nChapman reported from Newark, New Jersey.",

Investigators believe hackers working on behalf of China’s main intelligence agency are responsible for a massive data breach involving the theft of personal information from as many as 500 million guests of the Marriott hotel chain, a U.S. official said Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2018. (Kamran Jebreili, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON — Investigators believe hackers working on behalf of China’s main intelligence agency are responsible for a massive data breach involving the theft of personal information from as many as 500 million guests of the Marriott hotel chain, a U.S. official said Wednesday.\n\nInvestigators suspect the hackers were working on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, an official briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, said investigators were particularly concerned about the data breach in part because Marriott is frequently used by the military and government agencies.\n\nMarriott, which announced the data breach on Nov. 30, has not disclosed what it knows about the source of the hack, which included the theft of credit card and passport numbers over four years from guests who stayed at hotels previously operated by Starwood.\n\nMarriott acquired Starwood, which includes such brands as Sheraton, W Hotels and St. Regis, in 2016.\n\n“Our primary objectives in this investigation are figuring out what occurred and how we can best help our guests,” Marriott spokeswoman Connie Kim said. “We have no information about the cause of this incident, and we have not speculated about the identity of the attacker.”\n\nThe revelation of suspected involvement by China comes amid heightened tension with the U.S. over trade; the arrest in Canada on an American warrant of a top executive of Chinese electronics giant Huawei; and alarm among law enforcement officials about Chinese efforts to steal technology to bolster its growing economy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he would get involved in the Huawei case if it would help produce a trade agreement with China, telling Reuters in an interview Tuesday that he would “intervene if I thought it was necessary.”\n\nOfficials from the Justice Department, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that China is working to steal trade secrets and intellectual property from U.S. companies in order to harm America’s economy and further its own development.\n\nChinese espionage efforts have become “the most severe counterintelligence threat facing our country today,” Bill Priestap, the assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division, told the committee. “Every rock we turn over, every time we looked for it, it’s not only there, it’s worse than we anticipated.”\n\nPriestap said federal officials have been trying to convey the extent of the threat to business leaders and others in government. “The bottom line is they will do anything they can to achieve their aims,” he said.\n\nCyber-security expert Jesse Varsalone, of University of Maryland University College, said the Marriott hack does have signs of a foreign intelligence agency involvement. They included its duration and the fact that the information stolen, including details about travel by individuals, would be valuable to foreign spies.\n\n“It’s about intelligence, human intelligence,” he said. “To me, it seems focused on tracking certain people.”\n\nPriscilla Moriuchi of Recorded Future, an East Asia specialist who left the National Security Agency last year after a 12-year career, cautioned that no one has put out any actual data or indicators showing Chinese state actor involvement in the Marriott intrusion.\n\nIn the last few months, the Justice Department has filed several charges against Chinese hackers and intelligence officials. A case filed in October marked the first time that a Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence officer was extradited to the United States for trial.\n\nProsecutors allege the operative, Yanjun Xu, recruited employees of major aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, and attempted to persuade them to travel to China under the guise of giving a presentation at a university. He was charged with attempting to steal trade secrets from several American aviation and aerospace companies.\n\nSuch investigations can be time-consuming and difficult. The Justice Department is training prosecutors across the country to bring more of these cases, Assistant Attorney General John Demers told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “We cannot tolerate a nation that steals the fruit of our brainpower,” he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The company closed the Starwood deal in September 2016.\n\nPassport details, phone numbers and email addresses of some 327 million Marriott customers were exposed, according to the company. Credit card data may have been taken for other customers, it said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Marriott Chief Executive Arne Sorenson speaks during an interview with Reuters in a hotel in Berlin, March 3, 2015. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo\n\n“What makes this serious is the number of people involved, the intimacy of the data that was taken and the long delay between the breach and discovery,” said Mark Rasch, a former U.S. federal cyber crimes prosecutor.\n\nCustomers complained to Marriott through its account on Twitter, where Starwood was among the top trending U.S. topics. Some criticized the company, using terms including “duped,” “angry” and “merger disaster” to describe the incident.\n\nMarriott said it learned of the breach on Sept. 8 when an internal security tool sent an alert about suspicious activity.\n\n“We fell short of what our guests deserve,” Marriott Chief Executive Arne Sorenson said.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe offices of attorneys general in Connecticut, Illinois and New York said they would investigate the attack, as did the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office. A representative with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission declined comment.\n\nMarriott said it would inform affected guests about the breach starting Friday, and that it had reported it to law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\n\nThe breach appeared to be the second-largest on record after one at Yahoo in 2013 that exposed all of its 3 billion user accounts. That breach cost $47 million in litigation expenses and prompted Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to cut $350 million off the price it paid when it acquired most of Yahoo.\n\nMarriott said it was too early to estimate the financial impact of the breach and that it would not affect its long-term financial health. The hotel chain said it was working with its insurance carriers to assess coverage.\n\nBaird Equity Research said in a note to clients that breach-related costs, including legal fees, technical expenses and increased security, could force Marriott to delay the rollout of a new customer loyalty program planned for early 2019.\n\n“Investor sentiment toward Marriott could remain somewhat negative in the near term until this security incident is fully resolved and its true financial impact is learned,” Baird said.\n\nThe Hyatt breach highlights the need for companies to pay close attention on cyber security when making acquisitions.\n\n“Understanding the cybersecurity posture of an investment is critical to assessing the value of the investment and considering reputational, financial, and legal harm that could befall the company,” said Jake Olcott, a vice president with cybersecurity firm BitSight.\n\nStarwood brands include W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts, and Westin Hotels & Resorts.",

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nA slew of Democratic senators are calling for tougher privacy laws — and even steep fines for companies that fail to protect their customers’ data from data breaches — in the wake of Marriott’s admission that hackers compromised the personal information of up to 500 million of its customers.\n\n“We must set clear customer data protection standards for all companies — whether they’re hotel chains, online retailers, or big tech — and severe penalties for those who fall short,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) tweeted.\n\nSens. Mark Warner (Va.) and Ed Markey (Mass.) also pressed for tougher data security laws, and said Congress needs to set limits on how much customer data U.S. companies are allowed to store. Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) went even further — he said senior executives who ignore customer data privacy should face jail time.\n\nAfter potentially one of the largest breaches of consumer data in history, lawmakers appear ready to take a page out of Europe’s playbook to ensure it does not happen again: Their calls for aggressive penalties for companies that have poor data security are reminiscent of the General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect in the European Union earlier this year. The GDPR requires companies to adhere to a highly specific set of security requirements — and contains fines up to 4 percent of a company's annual revenue for violations. It is unclear, however, how such legislation would fare in a split Congress that appears poised for gridlock.\n\nWyden outlined on Twitter specific legislation that would impose “harsh fines and prison terms” for companies that misuse consumer data. The bill, which a spokesman said he is preparing to introduce early next year, would set up a new office with the Federal Trade Commission called the Bureau of Technology, give it sweeping powers to punish businesses for lax data security practices, and require it to hire 175 staffers to “police the largely unregulated market for private data.”\n\nThe bill would also introduce a new set of data security requirements, set up a “do not track” list for individual consumers to opt out of data collection online, and outlines “steep fines (up to 4 percent of annual revenue), on the first offense for companies and 10-20 year criminal penalties for senior executives,” according to a release from Wyden's office.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren also said there should be consequences for executives, tweeting, “CEOs won't take protecting our data seriously unless their own jobs are on the line.”\n\nTo address the current crisis, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday that Marriott that should pay for new passports for customers whose passport numbers were stolen.\n\nMarriott, for its part, seemed to admit a degree of culpability for the breach of its Starwood reservation system containing addresses, travel locations, credit card numbers, phone numbers, passport numbers. The breach could possibly leave droves of customers vulnerable to espionage or identity theft.\n\n“We fell short of what our guests deserve and what we expect of ourselves,” Marriott president and chief executive Arne Sorenson said in a release. “We are doing everything we can to support our guests, and using lessons learned to be better moving forward.”\n\nBut this apology was not sufficient for lawmakers, who insisted that businesses like Marriott can no longer be trusted to police themselves when it comes to data security.\n\n“It seems like every other day we learn about a new mega-breach affecting the personal data of millions of Americans,” Warner said in a statement. “Rather than accepting this trend as normal, this latest incident should strengthen Congress’ resolve.”\n\n“If history is any guide, Marriott’s mega data breach will be treated like all the others: the company will apologize and offer useless credit monitoring to the victims impacted,” Wyden tweeted. “The status quo isn’t working.” There have been several major breaches in the last several years that put hundreds of millions of customers’ personal information at risk: The breaches of Target and Yahoo in 2013; Home Depot in 2014; the health insurer Anthem in 2015; and credit reporting company Equifax last year.\n\nBut as of now, U.S. companies rarely face fines for breaches. The last major U.S. corporate cybersecurity overhaul was the 2014 Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, which led to a voluntary set of standards managed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). That law doesn't include fines for violations or data breaches.\n\nRon Gula, a cybersecurity investor who founded Maryland-based cybersecurity company Tenable Network Security, said Warner and Markey's idea that setting limits on personal information that companies can store would not be realistic for companies like Marriott, though he noted penalties might help improve their attitudes toward security.\n\n“When you book a Marriott hotel room it’s kind of nice that they already have all of your information when you book a room … they are always going to have to collect sensitive data on their customers,” Gula said. “So the only other option is to increase their cybersecurity. The only other thing you can do is just increase penalties.”\n\nOthers were skeptical that penalties would do anything to address the broader issue. As soon as there's a security mandate, some experts worried companies would focus on meeting the bare minimum that's required of them to avoid the fine.\n\nBusinesses “must demonstrate that they are investing in security, not just to meet the minimum threshold of what the law requires — but that protecting their customers is a pillar of their business,” Ellison Anne Williams, a former NSA technologist who is chief executive of a Maryland-based encryption company called EnVeil, told me in an email.\n\nSign Up!

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nPINGED: Facebook has said it never sold users' data, but internal communications seem to paint a more complicated picture. “Facebook executives in recent years appeared to discuss giving access to their valuable user data to some companies that bought advertising when it was struggling to launch its mobile-ad business, according to internal emails quoted in newly unredacted court filings,” The Washington Post's Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg reported. “In an ongoing federal court case against Facebook, the plaintiffs claim that the social media giant doled out people’s data secretly and selectively in exchange for advertising purchases or other concessions, even as others were cut off, ruining their businesses. The case was brought by one such company, Six4Three, which claims its business was destroyed in 2015 by Facebook’s actions.”\n\nMany companies that relied on Facebook's data via an application programming interface, or API, folded after the tech giant in 2014 “announced it was restricting developers' access to the API, citing privacy concerns from users who complained that their data was being shared with outsiders without their knowledge,” according to my colleagues. But Six4Three is challenging's Facebook's explanation. “Six4Three alleges that privacy was not the reason Facebook shut down the API,” Elizabeth and Craig wrote. “The developer claims Facebook realized that it could use its data feed as leverage, to pressure businesses to buy advertising that would fuel the company’s then-nascent mobile-ad business.”\n\nSen.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) introduced a bill that would create a program at the State Department to share information on election security with U.S. allies, according to a press release from Klobuchar's office. The bill, titled “Global Electoral Exchange Act,” would authorize the department to award grants to American nonprofits that focus on election security in order to share information with similar groups in allied countries. “Our intelligence community continues to warn that our elections—and those of our allies—are a target for adversaries,” Klobuchar said in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation will allow the State Department to work with our allies abroad to share information, discuss best practices, and combat the growing threat of election interference to democracies around the world.”\n\nMoreover, under the program, foreigners involved in administering elections would travel to the United States to study U.S. electoral procedures while American officials would have an opportunity to learn about other countries' election security efforts. A similar bipartisan bill sponsored by Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) passed the House in a voice vote in September. “The threats to our democratic electoral process and those of other democracies across the globe should not be taken lightly,” Sullivan said in a statement.\n\nOmar Abdulaziz, a Saudi opposition activist, poses for a portrait in Montreal on Oct. 17.

Kirkpatrick reported. “The spyware allows its customers to secretly listen to calls, record keystrokes, read messages, and track internet history on a targeted phone,” according to the Times. “It also enables customers to use a phone’s microphone and camera as surveillance devices. Because of those sweepingly invasive capabilities, Israel classifies the spyware as a weapon. The company must obtain approval from the Defense Ministry for its sale to foreign governments.”\n\nThe Saudi opposition activist, Omar Abdulaziz, has asylum in Canada and lives in Montreal. Abdulaziz and Khashoggi, who was a contributing columnist for The Post, collaborated on dissidence projects, the Times reported. “The lawsuit was filed by an Israeli lawyer, Alaa Mahajna, in cooperation with Mazen Masri, a lecturer at the City University of London,” Kirkpatrick wrote. “The lawyers say in the court papers that they intend to argue that the resulting exposure of the collaboration between Mr. Abdulaziz and Mr. Khashoggi ‘contributed in a significant manner to the decision to murder Mr. Khashoggi.’”\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\n— The United States and China will start negotiations to enact “structural changes” to their trade relations, according to a White House statement.

A cyberattack on the reservation system of Starwood, a Marriott subsidiary, allowed unauthorized access to information about as many as 500 million guests since 2014. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)\n\nU.S. government investigators increasingly believe that Chinese state hackers were most likely responsible for the massive intrusion reported last month into Marriott’s Starwood chain hotel reservation system, a breach that exposed the private information and travel details of as many as 500 million people, according to two people briefed on the government investigation.\n\nThese people cautioned that the investigation has not been completed, so definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. But the sweep and tactics of the hack, which took place over four years before being discovered, prompted immediate speculation that it was carried out by a country.\n\nPreliminary indications are the breach was executed by hackers affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal information not yet ready for public release. The MSS, an intelligence and security agency, has been behind many Chinese government intrusions into sensitive U.S. networks in recent years.\n\nSome U.S. intelligence officials believe that the breach was conducted to enrich the massive Chinese data sets on U.S. and other citizens that have been amassed for years, the people said. Such breaches include the 2015 Office of Personnel Management intrusion, which compromised personal data of more than 20 million government employees, family members and applicants, and also information collected during Chinese breaches of health-care institutions such as Anthem and CareFirst.\n\nThe FBI and other intelligence agencies declined to comment.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that investigators believe the attackers were likely to be the work of a Chinese state intelligence service.\n\nThe Marriott breach exposed an unusually broad array of data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers and credit card numbers, as well as information on where people traveled and with whom.\n\nSuch information would be valuable not just to criminals seeking to commit identity fraud but also intelligence agencies seeking to build dossiers and track movements of diplomats, spies, military personnel, business executives and journalists, according to several cybersecurity experts. Armed with a rich array of personal data, an intelligence agency can also tailor an approach to a person to see whether the individual can be recruited as a spy or blackmailed for information. The passport data, which is not often collected in data breaches, probably was a particularly valuable find for the hackers.\n\nThe people familiar with the investigation said the Marriott breach involved the same cloud-hosting space that Chinese state hackers have used in the past, and that one signature technique that involved hopping among servers also points to Chinese involvement. Another clue suggesting nation-state involvement was that none of the breached data has appeared on the “dark Web” or any of the forums that criminals typically use to sell stolen credentials and other valuable personal data.\n\n\"If it were a criminal act, people would be trying to sell it,” said one of the people familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe breach of the reservation system for Marriott’s Starwood subsidiaries was one of the largest in history, affecting travelers at the hotel chains St. Regis, Westin, Sheraton, Aloft, Le Meridien, Four Points and W from 2014 onward, according to a Marriott news release last month.\n\nMarriott acquired Starwood in 2016 and kept the reservation databases separate from its own until recently. The reservation system of Marriott hotels themselves was not affected by the breach. The Bethesda, Md.-based company has more than 6,700 properties around the world.\n\nAn internal security tool flagged the possible breach on Sept. 8 and later discovered that the hackers had accessed customer information and attempted to remove it in encrypted form, the company said. Marriott was able to decrypt the information and understand the extent of the breach only in November, it said.\n\nMarriott on Tuesday reiterated its previous comment on the data breach, saying in a statement: “Our primary objectives in this investigation are figuring out what occurred and how we can best help our guests. We have no information about the cause of this incident, and we have not speculated about the identity of the attacker.”\n\nChina’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment Wednesday. But a spokesman last week said that “China firmly opposes all forms of cyberattack and cracks down on it in accordance with the law.”\n\n“If offered evidence, the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to the law. We firmly object to making groundless accusations on the issue of cybersecurity,” spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press briefing when asked about the Marriott allegations.\n\nNews of the breach prompted several U.S. government officials to announce investigations, including New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Several members of Congress also publicly demanded answers.\n\nPrivacy advocates long have warned that travel data can provide remarkably precise insights into the lifestyles, tastes and personal relationships of individuals, but the industry has lagged behind others, such as banking, in securing information against hackers.\n\nTaylor Telford and Anna Fifeld in Beijing contributed to this report.",

By comparison, last year's Equifax hack affected more than 145 million people. A Target breach in 2013 affected more than 41 million payment card accounts and exposed contact information for more than 60 million customers.\n\nChris Wysopal, chief technology officer with the security firm Veracode, said the attack goes beyond traditional credit-card theft, as information about a person's hotel stay \"could be used to incriminate someone.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesse Varsalone, professor of cybersecurity at the University of Maryland, said hackers' access to the reservation system could be troubling if the hackers turn out to be, say, nation-state spies rather than those out simply for financial gain.\n\nThat information could mean knowing when and where government officials are traveling, such as to military bases or conferences, he said.\n\n\"There are just so many things you can extrapolate from people staying at hotels,\" he said.\n\nAnd because the data included reservations for future stays, along with home addresses, burglars could learn when someone wouldn't be home, said Scott Grissom of LegalShield, a provider of legal services.\n\nThe affected hotel brands were operated by Starwood before it was acquired by Marriott in 2016. They include W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Element, Aloft, The Luxury Collection, Le Méridien and Four Points. Starwood-branded timeshare properties were also affected. None of the Marriott-branded chains were threatened.\n\nEmail notifications for those who may have been affected begin rolling out Friday.\n\nThe full scope of the failure was not immediately clear. Marriott was trying to determine if the records included duplicates, such as a single person staying multiple times.\n\nSecurity analysts were especially alarmed to learn that the breach began in 2014. While such failures often span months, four years is extreme, said Yonatan Striem-Amit, chief technology officer of Cybereason.\n\nIt was unclear what hackers could do with the credit card information. Though it was stored in encrypted form, it was possible that hackers also obtained the two components needed to descramble the numbers, the company said.\n\nFor as many as two-thirds of those affected, the exposed data could include mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers. Also included might be dates of birth, gender, reservation dates, arrival and departure times and Starwood Preferred Guest account information.\n\nThe breach of personal information could put Marriott in violation of new European privacy laws, as guests included European travelers.\n\nMarriott set up a website and call center for customers who believe they are at risk.\n\nIt isn't common for passport numbers to be part of a hack, but it has happened before. Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific said in October that 9.4 million passengers' information had been breached, including passport numbers.\n\nPassport numbers are often requested by hotels outside the U.S. because U.S. driver's licenses are not accepted there as identification. The numbers could be added to full sets of data about a person that bad actors sell on the black market, leading to identity theft.\n\nAnd while the credit card industry can cancel accounts and issue new cards within days, it is a much more difficult process, often steeped in government bureaucracy, to get a new passport.\n\nBut one redeeming factor about passports is that they are often required to be seen in person, said Ryan Wilk of NuData Security. \"It's a highly secure document with a lot of security features,\" he said.\n\nWhen the merger was first announced in 2015, Starwood had 21 million people in its loyalty program. The company manages more than 6,700 properties across the globe, most in North America.\n\nWhile the first impulse for those potentially affected by the breach could be to check credit cards, security experts say other information in the database could be more damaging.\n\nThe names, addresses, passport numbers and other personal information \"is of greater concern than the payment info, which was encrypted,\" analyst Ted Rossman of CreditCards.com said, citing the risk that thieves could open fraudulent accounts.\n\nAn internal security tool signaled a potential breach in early September, but the company was unable to decrypt the information that would define what data had possibly been exposed until last week.\n\nMarriott, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a regulatory filing that it was premature to estimate what financial impact the breach will have on the company. It noted that it does have cyber insurance, and is working with its insurance carriers to assess coverage.\n\nElected officials were quick to call for action.\n\nThe New York attorney general opened an investigation. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, co-founder of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, said the U.S. needs laws that limit the data companies can collect on customers and ensure that companies account for security costs rather than making consumers \"shoulder the burden and harms resulting from these lapses.\"\n\n___\n\nChapman reported from Newark, New Jersey.",

Investigators believe hackers working on behalf of China’s main intelligence agency are responsible for a massive data breach involving the theft of personal information from as many as 500 million guests of the Marriott hotel chain, a U.S. official said Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2018. (Kamran Jebreili, File/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON — Investigators believe hackers working on behalf of China’s main intelligence agency are responsible for a massive data breach involving the theft of personal information from as many as 500 million guests of the Marriott hotel chain, a U.S. official said Wednesday.\n\nInvestigators suspect the hackers were working on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, an official briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, said investigators were particularly concerned about the data breach in part because Marriott is frequently used by the military and government agencies.\n\nMarriott, which announced the data breach on Nov. 30, has not disclosed what it knows about the source of the hack, which included the theft of credit card and passport numbers over four years from guests who stayed at hotels previously operated by Starwood.\n\nMarriott acquired Starwood, which includes such brands as Sheraton, W Hotels and St. Regis, in 2016.\n\n“Our primary objectives in this investigation are figuring out what occurred and how we can best help our guests,” Marriott spokeswoman Connie Kim said. “We have no information about the cause of this incident, and we have not speculated about the identity of the attacker.”\n\nThe revelation of suspected involvement by China comes amid heightened tension with the U.S. over trade; the arrest in Canada on an American warrant of a top executive of Chinese electronics giant Huawei; and alarm among law enforcement officials about Chinese efforts to steal technology to bolster its growing economy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he would get involved in the Huawei case if it would help produce a trade agreement with China, telling Reuters in an interview Tuesday that he would “intervene if I thought it was necessary.”\n\nOfficials from the Justice Department, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that China is working to steal trade secrets and intellectual property from U.S. companies in order to harm America’s economy and further its own development.\n\nChinese espionage efforts have become “the most severe counterintelligence threat facing our country today,” Bill Priestap, the assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division, told the committee. “Every rock we turn over, every time we looked for it, it’s not only there, it’s worse than we anticipated.”\n\nPriestap said federal officials have been trying to convey the extent of the threat to business leaders and others in government. “The bottom line is they will do anything they can to achieve their aims,” he said.\n\nCyber-security expert Jesse Varsalone, of University of Maryland University College, said the Marriott hack does have signs of a foreign intelligence agency involvement. They included its duration and the fact that the information stolen, including details about travel by individuals, would be valuable to foreign spies.\n\n“It’s about intelligence, human intelligence,” he said. “To me, it seems focused on tracking certain people.”\n\nPriscilla Moriuchi of Recorded Future, an East Asia specialist who left the National Security Agency last year after a 12-year career, cautioned that no one has put out any actual data or indicators showing Chinese state actor involvement in the Marriott intrusion.\n\nIn the last few months, the Justice Department has filed several charges against Chinese hackers and intelligence officials. A case filed in October marked the first time that a Chinese Ministry of State Security intelligence officer was extradited to the United States for trial.\n\nProsecutors allege the operative, Yanjun Xu, recruited employees of major aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, and attempted to persuade them to travel to China under the guise of giving a presentation at a university. He was charged with attempting to steal trade secrets from several American aviation and aerospace companies.\n\nSuch investigations can be time-consuming and difficult. The Justice Department is training prosecutors across the country to bring more of these cases, Assistant Attorney General John Demers told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “We cannot tolerate a nation that steals the fruit of our brainpower,” he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

                        "docText": "By Richard D. Harroch, Jennifer Martin, and Richard V. Smith\n\nData privacy, cybersecurity, and data breach risks are important due diligence issues in mergers and acquisitions. Post-acquisition discovery of security problems, and even notifiable breaches, is a far too common scenario.\n\nAccording to one report, more than a third (40%) of acquiring companies engaged in a merger and acquisition transaction said they discovered a cybersecurity problem during the post-acquisition integration of the acquired company. The most highly publicized example of an M&A-related cybersecurity problem was Verizon’s discovery of a prior data breach at Yahoo! after having executed an acquisition agreement to acquire the company.\n\nThis discovery almost scuttled the deal, and ultimately resulted in a $350 million reduction in the purchase price paid by Verizon, with Yahoo! required to pay a $35 million penalty to settle securities fraud charges alleged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and an additional $80 million to settle securities lawsuits brought by unhappy shareholders.\n\nThis article summarizes the growing potential risks—legal, financial, reputational, and operational—associated with cybersecurity, and also provides practical solutions on how to identify, understand, and mitigate those risks during the M&A due diligence process.\n\nCybersecurity Risk Landscape\n\nThreat Landscape\n\nEven for those acquiring companies that intend to scrutinize data security issues as part of the M&A due diligence process, often the lawyers conducting such diligence do not adequately understand the current cybersecurity threat landscape or don’t understand the particular risks associated with the target company. More often than not, the lawyers ask a battery of routine, privacy-related questions of a company even when that company does not collect or handle consumer personal data.\n\nThe focus on privacy, and not security more generally, is due in part to a general lack of awareness of broader cybersecurity issues, and a hyperawareness of the risks associated with data breaches. To a large degree, an overemphasis on data breach risks is not surprising since companies must publicly disclose breaches of personal data to consumers, and the media frequently focuses considerable attention on these breaches, especially large-scale ones.\n\nThe public is beginning to become more aware, however, of the threat of other types of information compromises, including ransomware attacks (in which data is rendered unusable unless a “ransom” payment is made), phishing emails (fraudulent emails sent to trick recipients into provide passwords or other valuable information), and the theft and selective disclosure of sensitive information for embarrassment and harassment (consider, for example, the Sony and Democratic National Committee hacks, in which sensitive emails were made public).\n\nOther Articles From AllBusiness.com:\n\nMoreover, companies have always grappled with the theft of proprietary information and trade secrets. While such thefts do not require notification to consumers, the theft of valuable intellectual property and trade secrets can have a devastating impact on a company, particularly young startup companies developing new technologies. The loss of valuable intellectual property can significantly decrease the value of a target company to prospective buyers. Similarly, the value of a company can be manipulated by trading on stolen inside information.\n\nIn short, criminal hackers are resorting to a broader array of techniques to monetize and exploit information, and the methods used to acquire that information are increasingly stealthy and sophisticated, making it difficult to defend against and detect such attacks. For example, through advanced techniques allowing for covert surveillance, attackers can monitor and steal data, often sensitive proprietary information or strategies (business, political, or military), over a long period of time without detection.\n\nBut the most serious computer threats do not target information or data at all. The NotPetya malware, a purely destructive attack, destroyed entire networks and systems for some of the largest companies in the world, including Merck, Maersk, and FedEx, and cost companies worldwide an estimated $10 billion in damages.\n\nOn a smaller scale, the manipulation of the software used in autonomous vehicles, for example, can result in personal injury or death. Or a single component part in a consumer product can be used to disrupt the availability of a vast swath of the Internet.\n\nLegal Landscape\n\nRegulators, customers, and investors have been quick to react to these evolving threats. A delay by a company in discovering and reporting a data breach can result in significant public criticism of the company as well as legal exposure, including the risk of substantial fines and potential liabilities due to class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative actions. The FTC and state Attorneys General frequently bring enforcement actions relating to delays in reporting a data breach, including in several high-profile breaches such as Equifax, Uber, and, most recently, Google+. Such scrutiny is also a risk for companies that acquire a breached company.\n\nThe SEC is also stepping up enforcement actions against public companies that fail to adequately disclose not only actual security incidents, but risks associated with cybersecurity. Specifically, pursuant to its February 2018 Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, additional public statements, and its April 2018 SEC settlement order with Yahoo!, the SEC has outlined its expectations for handling disclosure obligations relating to cybersecurity incidents.\n\nSuch obligations include, but are not limited to, having sufficient systems of internal controls and processes to ensure an appropriate level of risk-management oversight of an incident, including satisfying SEC disclosure obligations following discovery of an incident; amending or correcting prior material misstatements regarding cybersecurity in risk factor and MD&A disclosures; and instituting trading blackouts, as appropriate.\n\nIn fact, the SEC recently investigated nine companies that were victimized by a common cyber-related fraud scheme, whereby accounting personnel received fake emails purportedly from company executives or vendors to wire large sums of money to the perpetrators. Not only did those nine companies lose over $100 million in aggregate to the fraudsters, the SEC investigated them for potential violations of federal securities laws for failing to have in place a sufficient system of internal financial accounting controls.\n\nFinally, many highly regulated industries are required to comply with specific security standards and controls, and to promptly report incidents. For example, pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions are required to implement information security protections to safeguard financial information and to notify their regulators in the event of unauthorized access to such data. The healthcare industry is subject to similar requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).\n\nIn other sectors, more stringent requirements may apply. For example, as of January 1, 2018, companies that contract with the Department of Defense are required to comply with the NIST 800-171 standard and report any incidents that impact systems on which government information is stored or processed. Similarly, energy companies regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are required to comply with Critical Infrastructure Protection reliability standards; FERC is also currently working on mandatory cybersecurity incident reporting rules.\n\nIn addition, vendors, suppliers, and other providers of regulated companies are often contractually required to follow these requirements as well, regardless of their size. Thus, companies targeted for acquisition may also be subject to significant contractual obligations regarding cybersecurity. For example, companies that handle credit card information through an e-commerce platform, mobile application, or as a processing vendor are required by banks and credit card issuers to comply with the PCI DSS cybersecurity standards; a failure to satisfy those obligations can result in significant fines and even contract termination. More and more frequently, contracts are requiring vendors across industry sectors to comply with specific security requirements, and to notify contracting partners in the event of an incident.\n\nMitigating Risk Through Due Diligence\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it is imperative that an acquirer considering an acquisition fully investigate and identify the particular cybersecurity and data privacy risks and liabilities posed by the transaction. It is equally important that the selling company anticipate cybersecurity and data privacy issues. Notably, because a selling company may not even be aware of a prior or current compromise that may be pertinent to the deal, it is also incumbent upon the acquirer to consider other means of conducting due diligence in this area.\n\nAt a minimum, the acquirer’s due diligence investigation should focus on the following:\n\nIdentifying the particular types of privacy and cybersecurity risks the target company faces given its industry sector, geographic reach, and the nature of the products and/or services that it manufactures, develops, or provides.\n\nUnderstanding the network and system architecture and data flows, including the use of cloud providers and third-party applications.\n\nUnderstand the extent to which the selling company gathers and uses personal information, especially customer personal information and highly sensitive proprietary information, including information provided by business partners and/or governmental agencies.\n\nReview commitments and representations made by the selling company to its users and customers in connection with privacy and security issues, including contractual obligations.\n\nRecognize whether the acquirer will need to obtain any consents to use personal or private information of the selling company post-closing.\n\nAsk whether the selling company has experienced any prior cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches, and how it has responded to such incidents.\n\nDetermine whether the selling company has a written security program that meets current regulatory and industry standards and best practices, including with respect to organizational (policies), operational (processes), and technical controls.\n\nAssess the acquirer’s potential liability, compliance posture, and/or notification obligations that might exist after completion of the acquisition.\n\nIn the remainder of this article, we outline several types of due diligence inquiries and procedures that an acquirer may wish to undertake in connection with its investigation of data privacy and cybersecurity issues. As with any M&A due diligence review, the nature of the inquiry and the procedures employed should be tailored to the situation. Accordingly, not every item discussed below will be appropriate for every data privacy and cybersecurity due diligence review.\n\n1. Review of Selling Company Policies and Contracts\n\nInitially, an acquirer should request and review copies of various policies, contracts, and other documents of the selling company, including the following:\n\nCurrent and older versions of the selling company’s privacy policy\n\nWhether and to what extent the selling company has deviated from its privacy policies\n\nCurrent and older versions of any Terms of Use agreements\n\nTelemarketing and email marketing policies\n\nSecurity policies, including but not limited to the selling company’s Information Security Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, and Data Classification Policy\n\nResults of security audits and assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration tests\n\nPrivacy and security program maturity plans\n\nPrivacy impact assessment processes and assessment reports\n\nCertifications (e.g., ISO 27001/2, PCI DSS, SOC) and audit records\n\nA list of business-to-business customer contracts, particularly with public companies in the financial, health, energy, telecommunications, and other highly regulated industries\n\nContracts with the selling company’s vendors, suppliers, and providers\n\nIncident response plans and playbooks\n\nPrivacy and information security training materials, and a description of the training program\n\nEmployee background investigation processes and policies, and onboarding processes\n\nOrganization and reporting structure as it relates to the security function, and any information regarding executive management of cybersecurity and privacy risk\n\nGDPR-related compliance materials, as applicable\n\nSoftware development processes and documentation\n\nInsurance policies protecting the company from cybersecurity or data breach losses (including claims history)\n\nWhether there are appropriate systems of internal accounting controls to guard against fraudulent requests for money\n\n2. Review of Procedures to Protect the Selling Company’s Data\n\nThe acquirer also should review the procedures the selling company has put in place to protect its employee, customer, and business partners’ data and information as well as its networks and systems:\n\nDoes the company have a written cybersecurity program that establishes administrative, operational, and technical controls to mitigate security risks? Does the selling company have appropriate policies, including at a minimum an Information Security Policy, an employee-facing Acceptable Use Policy, and a Data Classification and Handling Policy? Does the selling company conduct regular risk assessments, and vulnerability and penetration testing of systems? Does the selling company have dedicated security personnel? Does the selling company perform an annual risk assessment relating to privacy and cybersecurity? Does the selling company train its employees on privacy and security best practices? Does the selling company have a comprehensive Incident Response Plan and is it tested? Does the selling company manage vendor risk? Does the selling company have a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, and back-up protocols? Does the selling company protect the physical security of its facilities and assets?\n\nDoes the selling company implement “reasonable” technical security controls (or comply with mandatory standards), including, for example, anti-virus software, encryption, access controls, network monitoring, authentication, and asset management?\n\nDoes the selling company have an insider threat program to detect the potential theft of proprietary information or intellectual property?\n\nDoes the selling company require privacy impact assessments when implementing new systems or processes?\n\n3. Review of Past Data Breaches Against the Selling Company\n\nThe acquirer should be especially concerned about past data breaches against the selling company or intrusions into its computer network.\n\nIs the selling company aware of any prior cybersecurity incidents, including but not limited to the compromise of sensitive data? A description or report of all prior known incidents should be requested.\n\nHow were any such incidents discovered or detected?\n\nDid the selling company conduct an investigation and what was the methodology and scope? Was a third-party forensic consultant engaged to investigate the incident? Any investigative reports relating to cybersecurity incidents should be requested.\n\nWhat was the impact of the incident on the selling company’s data or systems? What was the scope of the compromise or data impact?\n\nHas the selling company experienced any theft or suspected theft of proprietary information or intellectual property? If so, when and what kind of information was stolen? Was the subject of the investigation an insider (employee, contractor, or ex-employee) or a third-party intruder?\n\nHas the selling company experienced a potential breach of personal data? When? Were notifications made? Why or why not? Did the selling company consult with external counsel on legal obligations?\n\nHas the selling company been defrauded or extorted as a result of an email compromise?\n\nWhat remedial actions or patches were implemented to fix any vulnerabilities or other root causes that resulted in an incident or potential incident?\n\nHow often are networks, systems, applications, and other digital assets scanned for vulnerabilities or subject to penetration testing?\n\n4. Is the Selling Company in Compliance with Applicable Laws and Standards?\n\nThere are a variety of laws that set forth security and privacy requirements, including notification obligations, the scope of which depend on the selling company’s industry sector or the service or product it develops, manufactures, or provides. It is critical to understand what laws may apply to the selling company and to inquire whether the selling company is governed by and compliant with particular laws, regulations, and standards. Bear in mind that many of these requirements may be pushed down by contract to subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, and other providers of covered entities, even when such vendors are not directly regulated.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of potentially applicable laws for illustrative purposes (appropriate security or privacy counsel should be consulted in any particular M&A due diligence investigation):\n\nGeneral Consumer Privacy and Data Security Laws\n\nFederal Trade Commission – The FTC is broadly empowered to bring enforcement actions to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive practices and has developed a sort of “common law” with respect to regulatory expectations. The FTC has taken the position that “deceptive practices” include a company’s failure to comply with its published privacy policy and its failure to implement “reasonable” security measures to protect consumers’ personal information.\n\nThe FTC is broadly empowered to bring enforcement actions to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive practices and has developed a sort of “common law” with respect to regulatory expectations.

CAN-SPAM laws – Places restrictions on email marketing.\n\nPlaces restrictions on email marketing. Evolving federal and state laws – For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which imports EU GDPR-style rights for California residents around data ownership, transparency, and control.\n\nFinancial Services Industry\n\nGraham Leach Bliley Act – Imposes privacy and security obligations on insurance companies, banks and other covered financial institutions with respect to customer financial records.\n\nImposes privacy and security obligations on insurance companies, banks and other covered financial institutions with respect to customer financial records.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) – Information security standard that applies to organizations that handle branded credit cards; compliance with PCI DSS is historically a contractual requirement of credit card issuers and acquiring banks, but states are beginning to adopt it as a regulatory requirement.\n\nHealth Care Industry\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) – Provides privacy and security requirements and notification obligations to protect patients’ medical records.\n\nProvides privacy and security requirements and notification obligations to protect patients’ medical records. FDA Pre-Market and Post-Market Cybersecurity Guidance on Connected Medical Devices – Establishes best practices for the development and manufacture of connected medical devices throughout the life of the device.\n\nGovernment Contractors\n\nDFARS 252.204.7012 – Requires defense contractors to comply with NIST 800-171 security standards.\n\nEnergy Sector\n\nFERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards – Federal Energy Regulatory Commission standards.\n\n5. Review of Litigation and Complaints\n\nThe acquirer will want to carefully review any litigation or regulatory inquiries affecting the selling company:\n\nHas the selling company received any litigation claims concerning its privacy or security practices, including class action or shareholder derivative suits post-breach?\n\nHas the selling company received any governmental or regulatory notices about its privacy or security practices, including from the FTC, the SEC, state Attorneys General, or particular industry regulators? Is the selling company under a current regulatory (e.g., FTC) consent decree or monitoring order?\n\nHas the selling company notified governmental or regulatory authorities and/or affected persons of a data breach or other incident, and are mandatory notification requirements triggered?\n\nHas the selling company received breach of contract claims for failure to comply with contractual requirements, including post-incident?\n\nHas the selling company received privacy or security complaints from its customers?\n\nHas the selling company settled any claims or complaints? If so, on what terms?\n\n6. Other Pre-Acquisition Due Diligence\n\nCybersecurity due diligence also may require the consideration of more “invasive” technical methodologies unfamiliar in the traditional M&A due diligence context. The following additional steps are particularly important to consider when the seller or the buyer are in highly regulated and/or critical infrastructure industries, for government contractors, or where post-acquisition notification of prior breaches may be required.\n\nRequire the selling company to engage a third-party security company to run vulnerability scans or penetration tests on critical assets (for example, those that store sensitive data or valuable intellectual property) and applications.\n\nEngage a third-party security company to scan systems for artifacts of current or past compromises (no one wants to acquire a Russian Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) along with their investment).\n\nIf such measures cannot be taken prior to acquisition, an acquirer must consider such assessments prior to integration of networks and systems to ensure that any existing infections, malware, or compromises do not spread to the acquirer’s environment.\n\nConclusion\n\nCybersecurity due diligence has become increasingly important for M&A transactions. Savvy acquirers understand the potential for significant liabilities resulting from a selling company’s failure to properly identify and handle prior data breaches or other cybersecurity incidents. Less frequently discussed is how a prior cybersecurity incident may impact the value of a selling company, such as when valuable intellectual property has been stolen or when mandatory disclosure of an incident post-acquisition results in significant reputational damage and lost business.\n\nSimilarly, a failure to comply with contractual and regulatory requirements may require a buyer to invest significant resources to bring a selling company into compliance and to mitigate privacy and cybersecurity risks.\n\nA thorough and thoughtful due diligence investigation of the selling company’s cybersecurity and data privacy situation is critical for an acquirer to assess the risks and liabilities it may take on by making an acquisition, and whether such risks are relevant to accurately assessing the value of the target company.\n\nCopyright © by Richard D.

                        "docText": "(Reuters) - Marriott International Inc (MAR.O) said on Friday that hackers accessed about 500 million records in its Starwood Hotels reservation system in an attack that began four years ago, exposing personal data of customers including some payment card numbers.\n\nShares fell 5 percent after disclosure of the hack, one of the largest in history, which prompted regulators in Britain and at least three U.S. states to announce plans to look into the attack.\n\nThe hack began in 2014, before Marriott offered to buy Starwood for $12.2 billion in November 2015, acquiring brands including Sheraton, Ritz Carlton and Westin to create the world’s largest hotel operator. The company closed the Starwood deal in September 2016.\n\nPassport details, phone numbers and email addresses of some 327 million Marriott customers were exposed, according to the company. Credit card data may have been taken for other customers, it said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Marriott Chief Executive Arne Sorenson speaks during an interview with Reuters in a hotel in Berlin, March 3, 2015. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo\n\n“What makes this serious is the number of people involved, the intimacy of the data that was taken and the long delay between the breach and discovery,” said Mark Rasch, a former U.S. federal cyber crimes prosecutor.\n\nCustomers complained to Marriott through its account on Twitter, where Starwood was among the top trending U.S. topics. Some criticized the company, using terms including “duped,” “angry” and “merger disaster” to describe the incident.\n\nMarriott said it learned of the breach on Sept. 8 when an internal security tool sent an alert about suspicious activity.\n\n“We fell short of what our guests deserve,” Marriott Chief Executive Arne Sorenson said.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe offices of attorneys general in Connecticut, Illinois and New York said they would investigate the attack, as did the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office. A representative with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission declined comment.\n\nMarriott said it would inform affected guests about the breach starting Friday, and that it had reported it to law enforcement and regulatory authorities.\n\nThe breach appeared to be the second-largest on record after one at Yahoo in 2013 that exposed all of its 3 billion user accounts. That breach cost $47 million in litigation expenses and prompted Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to cut $350 million off the price it paid when it acquired most of Yahoo.\n\nMarriott said it was too early to estimate the financial impact of the breach and that it would not affect its long-term financial health. The hotel chain said it was working with its insurance carriers to assess coverage.\n\nBaird Equity Research said in a note to clients that breach-related costs, including legal fees, technical expenses and increased security, could force Marriott to delay the rollout of a new customer loyalty program planned for early 2019.\n\n“Investor sentiment toward Marriott could remain somewhat negative in the near term until this security incident is fully resolved and its true financial impact is learned,” Baird said.\n\nThe Hyatt breach highlights the need for companies to pay close attention on cyber security when making acquisitions.\n\n“Understanding the cybersecurity posture of an investment is critical to assessing the value of the investment and considering reputational, financial, and legal harm that could befall the company,” said Jake Olcott, a vice president with cybersecurity firm BitSight.\n\nStarwood brands include W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts, and Westin Hotels & Resorts.",

He worked for Beeline, one of the largest mobile phone operators in Russia.\n\nHe was approached by a man he had never met before, Andrei Bogodyuk, who immediately made a business proposal. He wanted Ryabov to access the phone records of someone he knew.\n\nLater that day Ryabov emailed Bogodyuk a long list of telephone calls and dates, for which he was paid 1,000 roubles (£12, $16).\n\nRyabov also supplied his new acquaintance with data from two more mobile phone numbers. But by then Beeline had spotted the data breach and had contacted the police.\n\nThe two were tried and sentenced to community service: Bogodyuk was given 340 hours and Ryabov 320.\n\nBooming illegal trade\n\nFast-forward a year and this method of acquiring personal data in Russia is already old-fashioned.\n\nThese days, private detectives, scammers or just jealous husbands can search illegal forums online and order the services of a hacker to give them an almost limitless supply of personal data.\n\nThe market for purchasing personal data in Russia is growing. For a modest fee, you can gain access to mobile phone records, addresses, passport details and even bank security codes.\n\nImage caption Black market websites have price lists for data on individuals\n\nThe illegal forums also have sections for accessing data from state organisations, including the Federal Tax Service.\n\n\"If the demand is there and there is money to be made, then someone will rise to fill that gap,\" said Harrison Van Riper, a research analyst at the cyber-security firm Digital Shadows.\n\nLeaks of official information happen in all countries. One of the best-known cases was that of Edward Snowden, a US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who, in 2013, released a trove of data about Washington's spying activities.\n\nRead more on Russian cyber-attacks:\n\nBut Russia stands out for the ease with which an ordinary person can obtain secret data held by state agencies.\n\n\"It's a combination of the classic problems of corruption and a degree of lack of control over access to the data,\" Mark Galeotti, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Russian.\n\nLax enforcement\n\nRussia only rarely prosecutes people for selling confidential data, but when such cases do go to trial, they offer a glimpse of how the trade works - and why it persists.\n\nIn 2016, in the Moscow suburb of Vidnoye, the deputy head of field inspections at the local branch of the Federal Tax Service was convicted after selling information about the income and assets of several Russians for 7,000 roubles. He received a fine and sentence, but both were waived under an amnesty to mark Victory Day.\n\nIn at least one case documented by the BBC, this failure to keep a lid on official data has backfired on Russia, exposing the activities of Russian spies.\n\nLast year, Dutch authorities released the names of several people it said were involved in spying. A search for those names in a Russian car registration database - which is supposed to be secret and controlled by the interior ministry, but has been leaked to murky private operators - revealed those individuals' addresses.\n\nThey were traced to a building in Moscow used by the GRU - Russian military intelligence.\n\nImage copyright FBI Image caption The FBI released this \"wanted\" poster, naming and picturing the seven men\n\nIt was an embarrassing revelation for a country run by President Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence officer, which prides itself on the excellence and secrecy of its intelligence services.\n\nBut Russia's security apparatus is up against powerful market forces. Officials can supplement their often meagre wages by selling data on the black market.\n\nTo find out how easy it was to order personal data, BBC Russian contacted one online forum and requested the personal data of one of its correspondents.\n\nWithin a day, and for less than 2,000 roubles, a file was emailed containing extracts not only from his current passport but from every passport he had held since the age of 14.\n\nImage caption Data for sale included a BBC journalist's passport details\n\nThe correspondent then revealed he was from BBC Russian and asked the seller to answer some questions. He agreed, asking to remain anonymous.\n\nHe told BBC Russian he thought of his operation as a \"detective agency\". After leaked information exposed the identities of Russian intelligence operatives, he said, there was a crackdown on the trade by Russian law enforcement. That forced some operations like his out of business.\n\n\"But they are gradually coming back. It's not something that can really be stopped,\" he said.\n\nAnd it's not only Russian citizens whose data can be bought: BBC Russian ordered information about the correspondent's wife, an EU citizen, and was given data including phone records, date of birth and passport information.\n\nOne person convicted of selling confidential data agreed to speak to BBC Russian. Anatoly Panishev, 28, an ex-employee of the mobile phone company Tele2 in Saransk, had sold the personal data of company clients.\n\n\"I only went into this because I was thinking about quitting my job,\" he said. \"Then a proposition came up. And so yes, I decided to make some money from it.\"\n\nPanishev earned more than 40,000 roubles in 2018 for his illegal activities, before being convicted and given an 18-month suspended sentence.\n\n\"A lot of other countries, particularly in Western Europe and North America, are very careful about data, because they need to worry about lawsuits and the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR],\" Mark Galeotti says.\n\n\"But Russia doesn't appear to have put as much security into protecting this data as it should have.\"",

Signatory countries account for about a quarter of the global economy.\n\nAlthough China has promised to decarbonise its energy system, it has continued to approve and finance coal projects, using $1 billion in “green finance” to fund coal-fired power projects in the first half of 2019.\n\nAccording to a study by environmental group Greenpeace, China has also invested in 67.9 gigawatts of coal-fired power in Belt and Road countries since 2014, compared to 12.6 GW of wind and solar.\n\nChina has also been criticized for investing in overseas coal-fired power projects using polluting technology no longer permitted at home.\n\nLi Gao, a senior Chinese climate official, told reporters on the sidelines of a briefing on Friday that as a matter of principle, China would not use outdated technology in overseas projects, but in practice this would depend on circumstances and the actual standards of the hosting country.",

People rarely open their windows as thick smoke billows from the huge chimneys of Serbia's main coal-fired power station.\n\nThings are only getting worse for residents living close to the Kostolac power plant complex in eastern Serbia, which is being expanded with a $715 million loan from a Chinese state bank and constructed by one of China's largest companies.\n\nWhen U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly withdrew from the Paris agreement on tackling global climate change in 2017, China was seen as the champion in the battle to cut carbon emissions and prevent a global environmental catastrophe.\n\nExperts say China is tackling pollution at home by implementing renewable energy projects and reducing the use of coal, by far the most polluting fossil fuel. But abroad, China is pursuing a different strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChinese companies are the world's largest investors in overseas coal plants. They are involved in building about a fifth of new coal-fired energy capacity around the world, mostly in the countries along its ambitious \"Belt and Road\" investment program, which is seen in the West as an attempt by China to globally increase its political and economic influence.\n\nBeijing has issued guidelines on foreign investments, urging environmentally friendly practices. But a major worry is that the guidelines aren't binding and that the power stations are built mostly in developing states that have low pollution emission standards, or no set standards at all.\n\n\"The (Chinese) central government explicitly stipulated that all 'Belt and Road' initiative projects should be green and low-carbon projects,\" China's special representative for climate change affairs, Xie Zhenhua, said in Beijing. \"Therefore, all projects underway introduced the most advanced technology to save resources and energy, and do its utmost to ensure emission reduction.\"\n\nHuang Wei, a Greenpeace climate and energy activist, said China has \"coal overcapacity\" at home, so the market space there for coal power companies \"is shrinking a lot,\" prompting Chinese construction companies to seek lucrative deals abroad.\n\n\"China is on the right track of fulfilling its domestic commitment on reducing carbon emissions. But its plan to invest in the 'Belt and Road' countries, especially infrastructure, could have a potentially big climate impact,\" she said.\n\n\"So far they (the Chinese government) define 'green' as complying with local environmental standards. We don't think that's enough, because a lot of the recipient countries have very low environmental standards. So I think it's up to China, both China and the recipient countries, to lift the standard,\" Huang said.\n\nExperts say the Paris climate goals can only be met by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.\n\nBut the Paris deal let countries set their own emissions targets. Some are on track, others aren't. Overall, the world is heading the wrong way.\n\nLast week, the World Meteorological Organization said globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a record in 2017, while the level of other heat-trapping gases such as methane and nitrous oxide also rose.\n\nThis year is expected to see another 2 percent increase in human-made emissions, as construction of coal-fired power plants like the one in Serbia continue while carbon-absorbing forests are felled faster than they can regrow.\n\nChinese construction workers wearing hard hats are building a huge chimney for the new \"Kostolac B\" Serbian power plant, which will be fueled by the light brown variety of coal called lignite — considered to be among the most heavily polluting fossil fuels. It produces huge amount of ash, which has to be carefully deposited on vast fields with water sprinklers to prevent the dust from being blown into the atmosphere or the nearby Danube River.\n\nSerbian state power company EPS says the new 350 megawatt unit, to be operational by 2020, will meet the highest environmental standards. More than 70 percent of Serbia's energy comes from coal while the rest is from hydropower.\n\n\"What is very important to emphasize is that we are doing this project absolutely in accordance with European standards and Serbian laws,\" said Zeljko Lazovic, the plant's EPS project manager.\n\nEnergy analyst Misha Brkic said Serbia's government \"is making a crucial mistake\" by insisting on the use of coal as fuel to produce electricity instead of focusing on renewable energy.\n\n\"The chosen (Chinese) partner does have money and offers technology, but we as a country that wants to build power plants or renew and modernize the existing ones, we don't have enough experience and knowledge and sometimes also not enough sense for European standards,\" he said.\n\nChina Machinery Engineering Corporation, which is expanding the plant, has refused to comment despite repeated requests.\n\nResidents living near the Kostolac plant say most of the pollution comes from the lignite ash field and the open-pit mine that will expand even further when the new plant starts production.\n\n\"When we wash our laundry, we leave it to dry and then in three days you see how white laundry becomes black laundry,\" said resident Dejan Grujic. \"When winds are strong, it is a catastrophe.\"\n\n___\n\nDake Kang and Liu Zheng contributed to this story from Beijing.\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/Climate",

Seoul said in April that it would halt state-backed financing of coal-fired power plants overseas.\n\n\"It's increasingly becoming difficult to get financing for coal projects,\" said Christoph Nedopil, the author of the paper and director of the institute's Green Belt and Road Initiative Center. \"With new guidelines for greening overseas investment from the Chinese government, we expect even less opportunities for coal projects in the BRI in the future.\"\n\nBRI funding across 140 countries totalled US$19.3 billion (S$26.2 billion) in the first six months of 2021, down 29 per cent from a year earlier, the IIGF said. Investment via the global infrastructure plan peaked in the first half of 2019, but has since dropped off due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Energy and transport accounted for 65 per cent of all BRI investment in the first half. Within the energy sector, 37 per cent of funding went to natural gas, 30 per cent to oil and 28 per cent to hydropower.\n\nChina is attempting to make its investments more environmentally sustainable. A BRI coalition supervised by the environment ministry developed a colour-coded classification system in December to help assess overseas investment risks. China's state bank chiefs have also called for a gradual pullback of coal financing and the central bank started grading the lenders' finance operations this month.\n\nThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China dumped plans to fund a US$3 billion coal-fired power plant in Zimbabwe in June.\n\nDespite these efforts, BRI funding for green energy dropped by 90 per cent in the first half from a year earlier, according to the report. The average deal size is also getting smaller, falling to US$550 million from US$1.3 billion in 2018.\n\nCoal projects are also facing growing resistance from local communities. Last year, more than 20 non-governmental organisations called on Chinese banks to withdraw support for a coal-fired power plant under construction in Turkey.\n\nCutting the amount of power generated from coal is essential to achieve the Paris Agreement's most ambitious target to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. G-20 ministers failed to agree last week on ending the use of coal, a key commitment that environmental groups hoped would be reached before the COP26 United Nations' climate talks in Scotland later this year.\n\n\"The political, economic, and diplomatic conditions are there for China to move away from coal projects in BRI countries,\" said Li Shuo, an analyst at Greenpeace East Asia. \"A moratorium on BRI coal is in China's self interest and will contribute momentum to global climate politics ahead of the year-end summit in Glasgow.\"",

                        "docText": "“China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy,” said China’s president, Xi Jinping, at the United Nations on Tuesday, “and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad.”\n\nIt was a short, ambiguous and not entirely unexpected sentence, but it came at a critical moment. UN-led climate talks in November at Cop26 in Glasgow will represent the first opportunity since the signing of the 2015 UN Paris agreement for countries to ratchet up the commitments in their pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Countries need to increase their NDC ambitions by five times if the world is to reach the goal of not warming by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Xi’s announcement, which effectively amounts to the end of international public financing for coal power, seems to match the ambition necessary for this moment.\n\nThe pledge speaks to a major fault line in the pre-Cop26 debates. China’s belt and road initiative – the grand plan to enhance trade and connectivity across much of the developing world, creating foreign markets for Chinese industrial overcapacity – was heavily weighted towards high-carbon infrastructure. On the presidential campaign trail last year, Joe Biden made sure to point this out. “China … and their belt and road proposal,” he said, “they’re taking the dirtiest coal in the world mostly out of Mongolia and spreading it all around the world.”\n\nSo, what does Xi’s statement mean? The announcement fell on the first anniversary of China’s pledge to make the economy climate neutral by 2060, either by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions entirely or balancing them with carbon removal. He also announced it unilaterally, at the UN general assembly, and thus tied it irrevocably to his personal political legacy. But questions remain: how will this coal phase-out be implemented? What is the fate of coal power projects that are already planned or under construction? What is the scope of the word “build”? Does it include an end to international financing for coal, too? What about Chinese labour or engineering on a domestic project? Does it cover private companies, or only state-owned enterprises and banks?\n\nIn the absence of clear answers, we might look to the effect of the 2060 announcement, a year ago. In short: it was huge (Climate Action Tracker found that the pledge alone lowered global warming projections by 0.2–0.3C, the largest single projected change it has recorded), and it did matter. Policies and sectoral roadmaps have been fleshed out in the intervening year. Slogans (“1+N”; “30-60”), which are an important part of Chinese governance, were set. And China’s vice premier, Han Zheng – also in charge of a fearsome central inspection team, with authority to swoop in and censure bodies that step out of line – took the helm of a climate “leaders group” overseeing the net-zero goal.\n\nProgress hasn’t been straightforward: China’s system isn’t smoothly technocratic, and there is a push and pull between core and periphery, incumbent and challenger industries. Things could be moving faster – particularly when it comes to phasing out China’s domestic coal fleet. China’s 14th Five Year Plan, for 2021-2025, will reduce the carbon and energy emitted per unit of economic output, and increase the share of renewables in its energy mix, but it does not commit the country to a carbon emissions or coal usage cap, as domestic environmentalists had hoped for. Its 2030 carbon “peak year” is relatively easy to achieve, and while China is known to “under-promise and over-deliver” on climate goals, the lack of ambition in domestic decarbonisation in the near term is a signal that the country is hedging things, in part due to an uncertain economic environment.\n\nYet this week’s announcement suggests, importantly, that China is willing to stay the course on climate diplomacy, despite rising geopolitical tensions, particularly with the US. The two economies together account for about 40% of global emissions and were, before the election of Donald Trump, a linchpin of climate cooperation. While foreign policy observers like to characterise China’s engagement on climate change as a “point of leverage” to force concessions in other arenas, Tuesday’s pledge shows that it is willing to move forward with decarbonisation unilaterally. In other words, high tensions with the US, which have continued with the Biden administration, do not appear to have weakened Beijing’s climate resolve.\n\nChina’s climate action ultimately reflect its self-interest. Political elites are aware of the country’s vulnerabilities with regards to global heating – its impacts on food and water security, and in chronic environmental stresses and natural disasters, as seen tragically this summer in Zhengzhou. Policymakers also recognise that climate action aligns with domestic economic priorities. China’s low-carbon industrial policy has positioned the country as the leading global supplier of clean technologies; the country has strengthened its energy security through electrification and decarbonisation; and it has used the shift away from polluting industries to move the economy “up the value chain” – towards innovation and services.\n\nIn the process, it has scored a soft-power win on the world stage, and at relatively low cost: the short-term pain may have industry insiders grumbling, but the economics of energy point towards renewables. China, at this point, is the last man standing on coal finance. Since 2013, China, Japan and South Korea provided 95% of that financing, with China the largest share, supplying $50bn, accounting for about 56GW of installed capacity. Japan and South Korea withdrew their support at the US-hosted Climate Leaders Summit in April.\n\nSo, perhaps it is low-hanging fruit, and China could start reaching higher up the tree. But we shouldn’t forget the other part of Xi’s sentence – his focus on supplying “green and low-carbon energy” for developing nations. This certainly won’t go unnoticed in the global south, where support from Europe and North America has been left wanting in recent years. The $100bn in climate finance promised for developing countries by rich nations at Paris has not materialised; access to vaccines continues, rightly, to be a point of tension; and countries are being implored to do more to address “loss and damage” – measures, such as compensation, required when vulnerable nations face devastating climate risks and adaptation is no longer possible.\n\nThere’s a lot of that fruit going unpicked. Another positive consequence of Xi’s announcement, therefore, would be if rich countries took it as a stimulus to start properly demonstrating their solidarity with the people in the world most badly affected by the climate crisis.",

At the same time, the country is reducing subsidies for renewable energy.\n\nAt the annual United Nations climate summit, this year in Madrid, government representatives will put the finishing touches on implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set a goal to limit future warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Nations may decide for themselves how to achieve it.\n\nAD\n\nChina had previously committed to shifting its energy mix to 20% renewables, including nuclear and hydroelectric energy. Climate experts generally agree that the initial targets pledged in Paris will not be enough to reach the goal, and next year nations are required to articulate more ambitious targets.\n\nAD\n\nHopes that China would offer to do much more are fading.\n\nRecent media reports and satellite images suggest that China is building or planning to complete new coal power plants with total capacity of 148 gigawatts — nearly equal to the entire coal-power capacity of the European Union within the next few years, according to an analysis by Global Energy Monitor, a San Francisco-based nonprofit.\n\nAD\n\nSeparately, investment in China’s renewable energy dropped almost 40 percent in the first half of 2019 compared with the same period last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research organization. The government slashed subsidies for solar energy.\n\nLast week in Beijing, China’s vice minister of ecology and environment told reporters that non-fossil-fuel sources already account for 14.3% of the country’s energy mix. He did not indicate that China would embrace more stringent targets soon.\n\nAD\n\n“We are still faced with challenges of developing our economy, improving people’s livelihood,” Zhao Yingmin said.\n\nChina is alternately cast as the world’s worst climate villain or its potential clean-energy savior, but both superlatives are somewhat misplaced.\n\nAD\n\nAs a fast-growing economy, it was always inevitable that China’s energy demands would climb steeply. The only question was whether the country could power a sufficiently large portion of its economy with renewables to curb emissions growth.\n\nMany observers took hope from a brief dip in China’s carbon emissions between 2014 and 2016, as well as Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s statement in 2017 that China had “taken a driving seat in international cooperation to respond to climate change.”\n\nToday the country’s renewed focus on coal comes as a disappointment.\n\nAD\n\n“Now there’s a sense that rather than being a leader, China is the one that is out of step,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki. He notes that several developed countries — including Germany, South Korea and the United States — are rapidly reducing their reliance on coal power.\n\nAD\n\nFossil fuels such as coal, gasoline and natural gas release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and changing the climate. Coal is the biggest culprit.\n\nLast year, coal consumption in the United States hit the lowest level in nearly 40 years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nOne place to consider the rise, pause and rise again of China’s coal sector is Shanxi province — a vast mountainous region in central China.\n\nShanxi is the heart of China’s traditional coal country, dotted with large mines, but also the site of some of the country’s largest solar and wind-power projects, according to state media.\n\nAD\n\nDuring most of the past 30 years of rapid economic growth, the coal business boomed in Shanxi and nearby provinces. As China’s cities and industries expanded, coal supplied much of that power, and China surpassed the U.S. as the world’s top carbon emitter in 2006.\n\nAD\n\nBut after climbing sharply for two decades, China’s emissions stalled around 2013 and then declined slightly in 2015 and 2016, according to Global Carbon Budget, which tracks emissions worldwide. This dip came as Chinese leaders declared a “war on pollution” and suspended the construction of dozens of planned coal power plants, including some in Shanxi.\n\nAt the same time, the government required many existing coal operators to install new equipment in smokestacks to remove sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and other hazardous substances. About 80% of coal plants now have scrubbers, said Alvin Lin, Beijing-based China climate and energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit.\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, the air quality in many Chinese cities, including Beijing, improved significantly between 2013 and 2017. Residents long accustomed to wearing face masks and running home air-filter machines enjoyed a reprieve of more “blue sky days,” as low-pollution days are known in China.\n\nAD\n\nAnnual levels of PM 2.5 — a tiny but dangerous pollutant — dropped by roughly a third across China between 2013 and 2017, from 61.8 to 42 micrograms per cubic meter, according to scientists at Beijing’s Tsinghua University and other institutions. They made the report in November in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n“That’s a big improvement, although in terms of safe air quality, we’re still not there yet,” Lin said. China’s pollution levels are still well above standards set by the World Health Organization.\n\nAD\n\nWhile these retrofitted coal plants emit fewer pollutants that harm human health, the scrubbers do not reduce greenhouse gases. “The new plants are good for air quality, but you still have all that carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere,” Lin said.\n\nAD\n\nIn the past three years, China’s carbon emissions have begun to rise again, according to Global Carbon Budget.\n\nThat trend was evident in the first half of 2019, when China’s carbon emissions from fossil fuels and concrete production rose 4%, compared with the same period last year, according to Myllyvirta’s preliminary analysis of Chinese government data.\n\nThe coming winter in Beijing may see a return of prolonged smog, as authorities loosen environmental controls on heavy industry — in part to compensate for other slowing sectors in the economy. Cement and steel production remain both energy intensive and heavily polluting.\n\nAD\n\nPermits for new coal plants proliferated after regulatory authority was briefly devolved from Beijing to provincial governments, which see construction projects and coal operations as boosts to local economies and tax bases, said Ted Nace, executive director of Global Energy Monitor.\n\n“It’s as though a boa constructor swallowed a giraffe, and now we’re watching that bulge move through the system,” said Nace. In China, it takes about three years to build a coal plant.\n\nIn November, Premier Li Keqiang gave a speech to policymakers emphasizing the importance of domestic coal to energy security.\n\nBut because China’s coal-power expansion is growing faster than energy demand, overcapacity “is a serious concern now,” said Columbia University’s Tu.\n\nAnd once new infrastructure is built, it’s hard to ignore.\n\n“It will be politically difficult to tear down a brand-new coal plant that’s employing people and supporting a mining operation. It will make it more difficult for China to transition away from coal,” Nace said.\n\nThe world has already warmed by 1 degree Celsius. All scenarios envisioned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for holding planetary warming to around 1.5 degrees Celsius involve steep worldwide reductions in coal-power generation.\n\nIn that effort, other countries rely on China to manufacture most of the solar panels installed worldwide, according to an analysis in the journal Science co-authored by Jonas Nahm, an energy expert at Johns Hopkins University.\n\n“If we have any chance to meet climate targets, we have to do a lot by 2030 — and we won’t be able to do it without China’s clean-energy supply chain,” Nahm said.\n\nChina’s manufacturing helped bring down the cost of solar panels by 80% between 2008 and 2013. Prices for wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries also dropped significantly, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n\n“China has a really mixed record. On the one hand, it’s seen rapidly rising emissions over the past two decades,” Nahm said. “On the other hand, it’s shown it’s able to innovate around manufacturing — and make new energy technologies available at scale, faster and cheaper.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Christina Larson on Twitter www.twitter.com/larsonchristina\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

                        "docText": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Coal power plant construction will push ahead in Asia despite falling electricity demand and environmental concerns as policymakers prioritise boosting economies crippled by the coronavirus pandemic, analysts say.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Coal barges are pictured as they queue to be pull along Mahakam river in Samarinda, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia, August 31, 2019. REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nFossil fuel demand will plummet this year as lockdowns sap electricity use, the International Energy Agency said in a report last month.\n\nThe European Union, International Monetary Fund and the United Nations have said that marks a once-in-a-generation opportunity to launch a ‘green recovery’, which includes Asia joining the global trend of ending support for coal power.\n\nBut there are already signs that China and other Asian giants like South Korea and Japan will steer recovery funds into struggling coal-focused state financers, equipment suppliers and construction firms. That could create a short-term jolt at the cost of efficiency and environmental damage, analysts say.\n\n“China and other governments may be tempted to invest in coal power to help their economies recover after the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Matt Gray, co-head of power and utilities at Carbon Tracker, a climate think tank. “This risks locking in high-cost coal power that will undermine global climate targets.”\n\nChina, which produces and consumes about half of the world’s coal, has in recent weeks said it would allow more provinces to start building coal power plants starting in 2023. It also accelerated the construction of five plants and committed billions of dollars to cross-country electricity transmission lines.\n\nChina’s coal imports in April surged 22% from a year earlier, as traders jumped on low prices to build stockpiles and prepare for a recovery in domestic demand.\n\nCoal power infrastructure in Asia relies heavily on state-backed financing from China, South Korea and Japan.\n\nJapan and South Korea are expected to continue to fund coal plants in developing countries like Vietnam and Indonesia to support state-backed industries hurt as domestic coal operations wind down to meet carbon-emission commitments, analysts said.\n\nMany planned coal-fired plants are not economically viable and will burden governments with stranded assets and billions of dollars of debt, analysts said.\n\nBAILOUTS\n\nThe global long-term outlook for coal power is gloomy. Governments, banks and energy companies - under public and investor pressure - are dropping the fossil fuel, which is seen as the greatest risk to the 2015 Paris agreement to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThat goal already looks out of reach, environmental experts say, partly because of new coal plants being built in Asia, the biggest energy-consuming region and largest growth market.\n\nAbout 500 gigawatts of coal power capacity is planned or under construction around the world, with an investment cost of $638 billion, according to Global Energy Monitor, an NGO supporting fossil fuel phase-out. More than 80% of that is in Asia.\n\nEven a handful of new plants will boost CO2 emissions and drive demand for coal mining in countries like Australia and Indonesia.\n\nTwo of Japan’s biggest banks, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc, announced plans last month to end coal financing, although the change does not apply to projects already announced.\n\nThe banks did not give specific details on each planned project, including the $2 billion Vung Ang 2 coal-fired power station in Vietnam, which activists have warned will be disastrous for local communities and the environment.\n\nSouth Korea’s Democratic Party announced a Green New Deal after its landslide election victory last month, including investment in cleaner energy and an end to coal financing.\n\nA month earlier, South Korea’s Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction Co Ltd, a leading constructor of coal-fired power plants, had made a quieter announcement that two state policy banks would provide it with a $2 billion bailout.\n\nSOUTHEAST ASIA\n\nDoosan Heavy is slated to provide equipment for coal plants in South and Southeast Asia, where emissions standards are lower than in South Korea, including the $3.5 billion Jawa 9 & 10 coal plants in Indonesia.\n\nThe Vung Ang 2 and Jawa 9 & 10 projects will proceed despite a bleak global investment climate and concerns of electricity over-capacity, two sources close to the projects said.\n\n“Coal is potentially less affected than other energy sources in Southeast Asia as economic and social stability may be prioritised in uncertain times like this,” said Shirley Zhang, principal Asia-Pacific coal analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.\n\nMeanwhile, there is bad news in the short term for renewable energy, even as analysts predict a transition to cleaner fuel across the world.\n\nWood Mackenzie estimates 150 gigawatts of wind and solar projects across Asia Pacific could be delayed or cancelled over the next five years as the downturn increases financing costs and draws focus toward more pressing economic priorities.\n\n“I don’t believe coal actually has any advantages over renewables,” said Andrew Affleck, managing partner of Armstrong Asset Management, owner of a Southeast Asia clean energy fund. “But with renewables’ financing constrained post-pandemic, Southeast Asian policymakers may ignore environmental impacts and buckle to the lure of Chinese build and finance coal power plants.”\n\nGraphic - Coal power projects in Asia: here",

At the same time, we’ve seen that it’s slow and difficult to change the status quo, no matter how compelling the economics of coal power are.”\n\nGlobal coal-fired power capacity Currently, the world’s total capacity for coal-based power is 2,068 gigawatts (GW). (Each represents 10 GW.) After pledges made in the run-up to and at the Glasgow summit, 351 GW of capacity is expected to be retired in line with Paris agreement goals. A further 1,628 GW, some 79% of total capacity, is expected to be retired, but not quickly enough to be consistent with a 1.5C pathway. The coal giants China, India and the US together account for the vast majority of coal-based power currently in operation — about 75% of global capacity. Only a small proportion of their coal power fleet — about 6% — is expected to be retired in line with Paris goals. In the rest of the world, 28 countries are set to retire their entire coal fleet in accordance with Paris goals, including Russia, Ukraine and Vietnam. The other 94% will not be retired fast enough under current plans, despite being covered by phase-out pledges or net-zero commitments. On top of this, experts are concerned about new coal capacity that’s set to come down the pipeline in the coming years. No new coal? While the world's appetite for coal has significantly decreased since the Paris agreement was adopted in 2015, there are still new coal-fired power plants being built. About 185 GW of capacity is currently under construction. There’s also another 309 GW in various of the planning stages. About 88 GW of this planned capacity will likely not be realised thanks to recent ‘no new coal’ and ‘no new coal financing’ pledges. Major public financiers like China, Japan, South Korea, and the G20 and OECD nations have all pledged to end overseas coal financing. A further 165 GW is not directly affected by those pledges, but is called into question by carbon targets . To meet their own emissions goals, governments would likely need to cancel these projects. Under current commitments, that still leaves at least 241GW of new capacity to be added. This leaves the world in a situation where, despite positive noises about the transition away from coal, the vast majority of coal power is yet to be assigned a firm phase-out date. Most of this untouched coal is in upper-middle and high-income countries. The International Energy Agency has said that in high-income countries, coal needs to be phased out by 2030, with no new coal-fired power stations built from now on. No planned phase-out Phase-out not in line with Paris agreement goals Phase-out in line with Paris agreement goals Called into question by carbon targets Likely not realised due to pledges\n\nThe data reveals how much responsibility higher income countries have when it comes to phasing out coal across the world.\n\nLeo Roberts, research manager at E3G, said that in addition to shutting down their own coal fleets: “Rich countries need to make the finance available to support the transition away from coal in the global south.\n\nHe added that investors and taxpayers should be concerned about the profitability of new coal plants. If those projects went ahead, they could lose $150bn (£113bn) on stranded assets, according to a report by Carbon Tracker.\n\nDespite falling behind on the schedule set out by the International Energy Agency, there are signs that key players are making headway in the transition. In India, “clean energy targets announced by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, mean that coal-fired power generation could peak well before 2030”, said Myllyvirta.\n\nAnd while the United States is not on track for a 2030 phase out, according to Global Energy Monitor, a shifting tide of economic factors and political will might bring the country in line. Roberts pointed to how the increasing uncompetitiveness of coal is already driving coal power plants retirements nationwide.\n\nOut of the three biggest coal-dependent economies, China’s status is surrounded by the most uncertainties. Though the country has pledged to stop building new coal plants abroad, it is still planning to increase domestic capacity. “Before China, with by far the world’s largest fleet of coal power plants, announces firm phase-out plans, we won’t be on track,” said Myllyvirta.\n\nBut despite uncertainty over China, experts say there is reason for optimism. The pace at which countries are abandoning coal has accelerated in recent years, and many new projects have already been cancelled.\n\n“The pace at which the [global] outlook has changed”, according to Myllyvirta, “from only a handful of small countries having a phase-out commitment as recently as 2015, to having a quarter of the world’s coal fleet assigned a firm phase-out date. It’s extremely encouraging and shows this can be done.”\n\nCoal-fired power capacity by country No planned phase-out Phase-out not in line with Paris agreement goals Phase-out in line with Paris agreement goals Show all",

Germany is planning the construction of 40 new coal-fired power plants, though officials claim the plants are based on technology that radically increases their efficiency. The Jaenschwalde power plant, built by the former East German government in the 1980s, emits 25 million tons of CO2 annually and is among the biggest single producers of CO2 emissions in Europe. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nA post-Covid economic rebound is good stuff. But it can sap the enthusiasm when it leads to supply chain disruptions and natural gas price spikes. If that causes more coal use, it could kill the global effort to curb climate change. And that is what is happening now, at least in energy-starved China and India.\n\nIndeed, those countries insisted on inserting language into the final COP26 pact to protect their interest — an agreement to “phase down” coal rather than “phase out” the fuel. Even in the United States and Europe, coal will still have a presence— one that will be significantly diminished and consigned to emergency power.\n\n“Coal is phasing out,” says Jeff Lyash, chief executive of the Tennessee Valley Authority. “We will shut it down before 2035. We have other technologies that are more cost-effective. We are on track to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2035 (from a 2005 baseline). We will be able to reach that reduction without raising prices. I worry less about India and China than our need to invest in developing the right technologies to become commercially available at scale. The U.S. can demonstrate leadership by developing those technologies.”\n\nTo that end, a critical pathway to net-zero by 2050 is to electrify global economies — a move away from high-intensity carbon sources and toward zero-carbon carbon fuels. That includes the development of wind and solar technologies along with long-term storage. It also means commercializing advanced nuclear energy as well as carbon capture and storage. And building a 21st Century transmission grid, too — one that can facilitate two-way communications between utilities and customers and carry more green electrons. Not to mention electric vehicles.\n\nLyash’s comments came during a webinar on Monday hosted by the United States Energy Association. The topic: the ramifications of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland that just concluded. This reporter was a panelist.\n\nThe United States has reduced its annual energy-related CO2 releases by about 1 billion tons since 2005. That represents a 14% reduction even as the U.S. economy grew by 28%. Falling wind and solar prices have made that possible. So has energy storage and the shift from coal to natural gas. The technologies to cut carbon levels by 80% by 2030 are here now. But the real challenge is to get the rest of the way by 2050.\n\nToday, 20% of all energy used in homes and industry is electric, says the Electric Power Research Institute. But that number could go as high as 60% by 2050, necessitating that electricity produced from clean resources replace those made from fossil fuels. “Accelerating the pace of electrification,” says Katie Jereza, vice president of corporate affairs at EPRI, “will reduce the overall energy bill.”\n\nMixing it Up\n\n30 October 2021, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rommerskirchen: The sky lights up over wind turbines and ... [+] high-voltage pylons near Rommerskirchen. Photo: Henning Kaiser/dpa (Photo by Henning Kaiser/picture alliance via Getty Images) dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nBut Duane Highley, chief executive of the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association — a cooperative with 45 members — raises valid points. He told the symposium that his utility is moving at light speed to clean energy and that this will require an expanded transmission grid. Moreover, he says that fossil fuels will remain part of the Mountain West’s energy picture. Recent weather events, for example, have necessitated the use of fuel oil — a resource that is hardly ever used but that for five days saved a ton of money as natural gas prices shot up.\n\n“We still need to keep fossil fuels in the mix,” says Highly. “As we get to that last 20% in carbon reductions, would those dollars be better invested elsewhere” — to help developing countries get to at least 50% reductions in CO2? “There’s been so much economic effort on our end.”\n\nHow are the more affluent countries supposed to help emerging nations— a question that has been lingering since the early climate talks in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan? The answer: some form of a “just transition” to allow countries that are now dependent on coal to rely instead on cleaner resources. And that involves some financial and technological help.\n\nIndeed, the International Energy Agency in Paris says that 2021 will bring a 4.5% increase in coal use. That is greater than the 2019 demand. And Asia is responsible for at least three-quarters of that increase. Higher natural gas prices, which should moderate in time, are the catalyst.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to keep temperature increases from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit from pre-industrial levels. An earlier agreement had the globe’s wealthiest nations paying $100 billion a year from 2019 to 2025. The money would go to buying the latest and most remarkable technologies to achieve success. If the world fails to meet those objectives, the cost will be high: $2 billion a day in economic losses because of extreme weather events, says the Universal Ecological Fund. That makes international technical support and financial assistance a must.\n\n“When we took on the role of COP presidency, I said very clearly that I wanted us to try and consign coal power to history,” says Britain’s President for COP26 Alok Sharma, at a COP26 press conference.\n\nHigh Hurdles\n\nHUAINAN, CHINA - JUNE 16: Chinese men exercise under a cooling tower at a coal fired power plant ... [+] near the site of a large floating solar farm project under construction by the Sungrow Power Supply Company on a lake caused by a collapsed and flooded coal mine on June 16, 2017 in Huainan, Anhui province, China. The floating solar field, billed as the largest in the world, is built on a part of the collapsed Panji No.1 coal mine that flooded over a decade ago due to over-mining, a common occurence in deep-well mining in China's coal heartland. When finished, the solar farm will be made up of more than 166,000 solar panels which convert sunlight to energy, and the site could potentially produce enough energy to power a city in Anhui province, regarded as one of the country's coal centers. Local officials say they are planning more projects like it, marking a significant shift in an area where long-term intensive coal mining has led to large areas of subsidence and environmental degradation. However, the energy transition has its challenges, primarily competitive pressure from the deeply-established coal industry that has at times led to delays in connecting solar projects to the state grid. China's government says it will spend over US $360 billion on clean energy projects by 2020 to help shift the country away from a dependence on fossil fuels, and earlier this year, Beijing canceled plans to build more than 100 coal-fired plants in a bid to ease overcapacity and limit carbon emissions. Already, China is the leading producer of solar energy, but it also remains the planet's top emitter of greenhouse gases and accounts for about half of the world's total coal consumption.

And in the U.S., most U.S. investor-owned utilities have pledged to be net-zero by 2050. Duke Energy DUK , Entergy Corp. ETR , and Xcel Energy XEL are among those leaders.\n\nEdison International EIX is another utility aiming high — part of California’s regulatory effort to limit CO2 releases. The state wants to reduce CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 40% by 2030 and to be net-zero by 2045. It also hopes to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks by 2035.\n\n“The most affordable way to get to net-zero by 2045 is through renewables ... and minimal use of fossil fuels,” says Pedro Pizarro, chief executive of Edison International, at an earlier event. “We see about 6% of electrons in 2045 still coming from gas ... Across California, adding 80 gigawatts of renewables and 30 gigawatts of bulk power storage .. would require something like $175 billion ... between now and 2045, plus another $70 billion or so of investment on the grid side to make sure the grid can manage all that.”\n\nThat means adding sensors to monitor equipment and to prevent grid overload. While the load has been flat, electricity usage is projected to rise by 60% by 2045 in Edison’s service territory — a function of electrification, including cars. But Pizarro also says that energy bills will be 30% lower than they are today.\n\nHowever, it’s clear that coal usage will remain a staple in some developing economies — for decades. If that is the case, carbon capture is critical.\n\n“Fossils will play a role,” says Eric Holdsworth, managing director for clean energy and environmental policy at the Edison Electric Institute, during the symposium. “We need carbon capture and sequestration for coal and natural gas. It could be applied elsewhere in the world. We need all the tools in the toolbox, including renewables, advanced nuclear, and hydrogen. It does not matter who develops the technology. It matters that we get to 100% clean energy. Start investing now. We need to know if they are scalable on the system.”\n\nAnd if wind and solar gain market share, the transmission system must be expanded — another political hot potato.\n\n“It is all about political pressure,” says Jeff Lyash, TVA’s CEO. “I’ve never built a plant that didn’t have political opposition to it. We need the right mix of technologies to get to the ultimate outcome. If they understand how those investments will solve the problem, they will embrace it. We can get more out of our existing asset even as we add to it.”\n\nIf climate change is allowed to slide, the environmental and economic tolls will follow. Nations are thus embracing low-carbon energy strategies. But the challenges are daunting: developing countries will be slower to shed their coal plants while the richer ones must hasten their development of tomorrow’s technologies — to finish the last lap to net-zero. The political and financial obstacles are high hurdles. But if global leaders trip up, climate change will be the winner — not the other way around.",

                        "docText": "In late February Peter Coates, Glencore's non-executive director, appeared at an event in Sydney to make a rare intervention from a mining leader — a full-throated defence of the coal industry, whose very existence is under threat because of its role in global warming.\n\n\"Our industry has allowed itself to be cast as the villain too often,\" said Coates, a veteran coal executive, at the mining industry event. \"We have allowed the vacuum, about what we do and how we do it, to be filled by celebrity scientists and radical activists whose purpose is not to seek solutions but to divide and destroy.\"\n\nSix months later, the industry decided to take action to improve the image of the dirty fuel. Coal21, an industry body in Australia that is backed by 26 mining groups including BHP, Anglo American and Glencore, launched a new US$4 million ($6.2m) advertising drive. It issued a tender for a campaign on Australian TV, social media, radio and print advertising, according to a document seen by the FT.\n\n\"The campaign is targeted at men aged 18 to 39 and women aged 40 and over — 'soft converters' identified by previous research as having limited information about the Australian coal industry and open to being convinced of its future role,\" the pitch says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe core idea of the campaign is a technical fix — the concept that coal can be made cleaner by capturing the carbon emissions from coal-fired power stations and storing them underground.\n\nThese \"low-emissions technologies\", as Coal21 describes them, are now the centrepiece of the US$360 billion coal industry's efforts to ensure its survival — a push that supporters believe could play an important role in limiting global warming but which critics believe is an expensive exercise in reputation-laundering.\n\nAs well as the marketing push in countries such as Australia, carbon capture technologies have also received backing from President Donald Trump, who has pledged to revive coal mining in the country, as well as Congress, which has given tax breaks to those who install carbon capture and storage facilities.\n\nBut the coal industry's lobbying has raised concerns among critics and investors, who say it is an unwise bid to prolong coal's life in a world of ever cheaper renewable energy such as wind and solar. In addition, they say technologies to extract carbon from power plants are prohibitively expensive and better suited to other industrial sectors such as oil and gas production.\n\nChina is the world's largest coal consumer. Photo / 123RF\n\n\"It's a very sophisticated media play — it's just public relations. There is no such thing as clean coal, our reliance on coal is not compatible with a liveable planet,\" Brynn O'Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, says.\n\n\"It's an industry in an existential fight and they will do whatever they can to survive. They are making impossible a transition that will make the rest of the economy resilient with the inevitability of climate change.\"\n\nTechnology to remove carbon emissions and bury them has been around for over 40 years, and is predominantly used in natural gasfields. The Sleipner gasfield in the North Sea, which started capturing carbon emissions in 1996, removes around 1m tonnes of CO2 every year.\n\nAs emissions rise, the technology has received renewed attention as a solution to global warming, especially for sectors such as steel and cement, which are energy intensive and hard to decarbonise because of the materials they use. Every tonne of steel, for instance, requires 800 kilogrammes of metallurgical coal, according to Glencore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, many in the energy sector are unconvinced about the efficacy of using the technology for coal. There are questions about whether carbon capture and storage should be put in coal-fired power plants because wind, solar and batteries are increasingly competitive on price.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan estimate that renewable energy is cheaper than coal in India, China and the US, the three largest coal-consuming countries.\n\n\"It's not a wise use of resources,\" says Simon Lewis, a professor at University College London. \"It makes no sense to invest heavily in expensive technology that is itself energy intensive to strip the CO2 from the flue gas and pump it underground, just to keep on using coal when there are alternatives available.\"\n\nThe World Coal Association, the coal industry's main global lobbying organisation, defends the technology, arguing that it has \"a proven 90 per cent capture rate of the CO2 produced from the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and industrial processes\".\n\nThe International Energy Agency's Clean Coal Centre in London says carbon capture and storage is needed for the simple reason that there are still so many coal-fired power plants in operation. Coal plants currently contribute around a third of CO2 emissions, and half of them are less than 15 years old. Adding carbon capture technology \"may significantly reduce or even neutralise CO2 emissions\", the IEA says.\n\nIt forecasts that meeting the Paris climate agreement's target of keeping global warming \"well below\" 2 degrees will require some 210 gigawatts of coal-fired plants to be fitted with carbon removal technology by 2040.\n\n\"Models showing how best to reach ambitious climate goals like 2 degrees or below continue to show huge amounts of CCS in the coal power sector,\" says Toby Lockwood, an analyst at the Clean Coal Centre.\n\nWhatever the theoretical case, the reality is that the coal power industry is woefully behind its own carbon capture targets. So far, just two large projects that remove carbon emissions are operating at scale, which means just over 2.4m tonnes of CO2 is being removed a year. That compares with the 10bn tonnes of CO2 emitted by coal-fired power plants last year, according to the IEA.\n\nThe Sleipner gasfield in the North Sea removes around 1m tonnes of CO2 every year. Photo / 123RF\n\nLocated in Canada's coal-rich Saskatchewan province, the US$1.3b, 115MW Boundary Dam carbon capture project was launched in 2014 with a goal of capturing 90 per cent of its CO2 emissions and transporting them to nearby oilfields, where the gas is used to recover oil. SaskPower, the plant operator, said it would be the equivalent of taking 250,000 cars off the road.\n\nThe plant received backing from BHP, which built a \"knowledge centre\" at Boundary Dam with the aim of stimulating \"broader deployment\" of carbon capture and storage technologies.\n\nThe US$1b Petra Nova project in Houston is the only other large operation. Backed by a US$190m grant from the US Department of Energy, it captures CO2 from one unit at the WA Parish Generating Station power plant, owned by NRG Energy. The CO2 is pumped through an 80-mile tunnel to the West Ranch oilfield, also in Texas, where it is used to boost oil production.\n\nBoundary Dam says it has removed 2.8m tonnes of CO2 since it launched, while Petra Nova says that when it is operating at 100 per cent capacity it removes 90 per cent of the CO2 at its plant, or 5,200 tonnes a day — the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road.\n\nBut David Schlissel, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says both plants have not lived up to their hype. The Petra Nova plant captures just over a third of the total flue gas from just one of four coal-fired units, he says. And Boundary Dam has an overall capture rate of 51 per cent, he says — well below the 90 per cent target.\n\nSchlissel estimates that the cost of adding carbon capture and storage to an average US coal plant is almost four times the cost of solar and storage in parts of the US. In addition, using the CO2 to extract oil only adds to emissions when the oil is burnt, he says.\n\n\"It's really expensive and the coal plants can't compete [with wind or solar and storage],\" he says. \"It's basically a plan to keep uneconomic coal plants operating. It's a fantasy.\"\n\nIn China, the world's largest coal consumer where the power sector accounts for around 40 per cent of its total carbon emissions, carbon capture and storage has moved no faster. Seven small carbon capture and storage projects are planned or have started operations, according to consultancy CRU China. But they capture less than 5 per cent of the CO2 emissions by the seven plants.\n\nThe consultancy estimates the technology is only viable if the CO2 can be sold to other industries. Without that the cost of the technology needs to fall by 50 per cent to make pure CO2 storage economic. \"The current state of the technology development means that it is unlikely to make a significant contribution to lowering Chinese CO2 emissions,\" says Lize Wan, an analyst at CRU.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, a senior coal campaigner at Greenpeace, says that carbon capture capacity does not yet match the emissions of one large coal-fired plant let alone the estimated global capacity, which is equivalent to 2,000 large-scale plants.\n\n\"The reason why mining companies promote the concept is to try and reassure investors that coal has a future even in a world that takes climate change seriously,\" he says.\n\n\"They have a way out. It's only about hyping up the hypothetical possibility as a response to strengthening climate policies. But nobody in their right mind is proposing building plants with CCS [carbon capture and storage] equipment now.\"\n\nAnalysts estimate that renewable energy is now cheaper than coal power in China. Photo / 123RF\n\nNone of this scepticism is stopping investment in carbon capture by the mining companies, which face growing investor pressure to divest from coal as well as falling prices. This year, prices for seaborne coal have dropped 35 per cent as natural gas supply has increased.\n\nIn July BHP, the world's largest mining group, pledged to spend US$400m over five years to reduce its emissions and those of its customers, and said carbon capture and storage on coal remained part of the solution, both for steel and for power plants.\n\nThe miner is a member of Coal21, which is funded by a voluntary levy on Australian coal production. But some investors are growing uncomfortable with BHP's membership of coal lobbying groups and worry that the industry is using publicity campaigns to avoid making hard decisions about the long-term future of its coal assets.\n\n\"There needs to be much firmer detail on exactly what role CCS will play and how viable it is,\" says Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board. \"Coal21 has gone beyond the research and the role it was set up to do to a much broader role of lobbying for sentiment towards coal. That is an increasingly questionable use of shareholder funds to support such activity.\"\n\nGlencore, the world's largest coal exporter, is building a pilot carbon capture and storage project in the Surat basin, a vast sandstone geological basin in Australia, backed by money from Coal21 and Canberra. The project aims to store 200,000 tonnes a year of CO2 from a nearby coal-fired power plant.\n\nBut it too has come under pressure from investors concerned about climate change. Coates's speech came the same month that Glencore agreed to cap its coal production for the first time, at 150m tonnes a year, a sharp turnround for a company that had been acquiring coal mines.\n\nCoates said it was unrealistic to think about a world without heavy use of coal. The fuel remains the \"lowest cost option and is the energy source of choice for the developing world\", he said. There are over 2,300 coal-fired power stations under construction or planned worldwide, especially in south-east Asia, he said, according to a transcript of the speech.\n\n\"More not less coal will be used in the future,\" said Coates.\n\nUK Gas surge ends carbon capture plans for coal\n\nIn 2013 the Aberthaw coal-fired power station in Wales trapped its first tonne of carbon — in a pilot project that was hailed as a way to reduce harmful emissions from coal burning.\n\nThis August, however, the plant's owner, German utility RWE, said the Aberthaw plant would shut in 2020, leaving just four remaining coal-fired plants in the UK. This year renewable energy sources of power are set to surpass coal in the country for the first time since the industrial revolution.\n\n\"Market conditions made this decision necessary,\" Roger Miesen, chief executive of RWE Generation, says.\n\nThe decline of coal in the UK, which has happened much faster than anticipated due to cheaper natural gas as well as plunging prices for wind and solar, reads like a cautionary lesson for other countries still dependent on the fuel.\n\n\"Part of the original ambition in the UK was to develop CCS [carbon capture and storage] as a way of keeping the coal industry going to feed our domestic industry of coal-fuelled electricity,\" Stuart Haszeldine, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, says. \"But circumstances conspired so that became no longer necessary and we discovered natural gas. Coal plants became less and less economic.\"\n\nInstead of coal, this February UK power company Drax captured carbon from the burning of biomass at its North Yorkshire power plant, the first time carbon has been captured from a wood-burning power plant globally.\n\nDrax, which was opened in 1975 to use coal from the nearby Selby coalfield, started switching its units to burn compressed wood pellets in 2013. Today two-thirds of its power is from burning wood pellets, and the remaining one-third from coal.\n\nAdding carbon capture technology to Europe's ageing fleet of coal-fired power plants is not economical, Haszeldine adds.\n\nWritten by: Henry Sanderson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Financial Times\n\n",

Chinese policy banks have committed some $45 billion to coal projects overseas since 2000, according to a Boston University database.\n\nThat pattern may be starting to crack. Pakistan, which has been working on an aggressive expansion of new coal power plants under the Belt and Road’s China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, is getting cold feet. The country’s planning minister has told Beijing that it’s not interested in developing the Rahim Yar Khan plant, a potential 1.32 gigawatt project that would probably have left the country’s grid well over capacity.\n\nWhile the big beasts of potential coal development are China and India, smaller second-ranked markets such as Pakistan are likely the tougher nuts to crack to wean the world from its most polluting fossil fuel.\n\nTurkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan and the Philippines together have about 144,729 megawatts of coal plants that are between initial announcements and their first concrete pour, according to CoalSwarm, a group that tracks project activity. That’s more than the 139,656 megawatts of projects at the same stage in China and India.\n\nWhereas new wind and solar is already cheaper than coal in those two countries – one reason project cancellations there are only likely to increase – that’s often not the case in smaller emerging markets, where the plug-and-play availability of thermal plants plus the existence of overseas developers seeking to build them can still look tempting. As my colleague Liam Denning wrote last year, coal is like junk food: ubiquitous, full of calories and (at least at the building stage) cheap.\n\nStill, power generation is more about long-term than short-term costs, and with fuel accounting for about half the price of coal generation, the presence of willing foreign builders can only stave off economic reality for so long.\n\nCoal in the Thar region east of Karachi already costs about twice that of equivalent lignite in other markets and the area’s multiple thermal projects may become uncompetitive, Syed Akhtar Ali, a former member of the country’s Planning Commission, wrote in the Express Tribune last year.\n\nThat dynamic is accentuated by the speed at which rival sources of energy are dropping in price. Pakistan has a rich endowment of wind and solar resources and has already joined the club of countries where the costs of new renewables are lower than coal.\n\nLong-run costs for wind projects are at about half the cost of coal, according to government data cited by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Given the low penetration of variable renewables and high share of natural gas, solar and wind won’t even need significant storage backup to maintain grid stability.\n\nAs a result, building thermal plants would saddle citizens with higher electricity prices than they’d pay for renewables, on top of contributing to choking pollution and peak summertime temperatures that may rise to the edge of survivability.\n\nUnfortunately, economic reality and the dangers of climate change alone won’t be enough to halt the juggernaut of externally funded coal. In contrast to thermal projects, renewables in Pakistan have suffered from a lack of policy clarity as well as outright obstruction by the government’s power distribution company, which “has continually acted in an ad-hoc and discriminatory manner” toward independent power producers, according to the country’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority.\n\nThanks in part to that backdrop, current plans see wind, solar and biomass rising to just 8.3 percent of Pakistan’s energy mix in 2025 from 5.6 percent today, while coal will climb to 20 percent from 3.1 percent.\n\nWith new Prime Minister Imran Khan seeking to trim outlays to avoid a fresh bailout from the International Monetary Fund, taking the scissors to these projects should be a good place to start. Maximizing Pakistan’s abundant renewable resources would be cheaper, nimbler, and better for the long-term future of its sweltering population. New fossil fuel projects should be banned, as energy consultant Khurrum Lalani argued last year. It’s not too late for Pakistan to embrace the future.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nDavid Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

This is because both Ankara and Moscow’s relations are at their lowest in recent years.\n\nEuropean countries are also raising a lot of apprehensions over Turkey’s obsession for nuclear weapons, as Ankara might use it against them.\n\nThe China-Pakistan-Turkey nuclear nexus is going to have a deeper repercussion on the security of both the Indo-Pacific region along with South Asia. Already another rogue state North Korea is posing a similar threat.\n\nNEW DELHI: The existing unholy nexus among China Turkey and Pakistan in the clandestine nuclear program is posing a serious threat to both regional and global security. What is required is that international institutions like the UN and IAEA take strong punitive measures against Beijing, Ankara and Islamabad for their illegal and clandestine activities in the nuclear weaponisation process.Along with the Covid-19 crisis which is posing a threat to global security, another issue which is causing equal alarm and concerns in the global community is the nexus between Turkey and Pakistan, two rogue states in the field of nuclear weaponisation process. Along with these two, China and North Korea are also involved in the illicit transfer of nuclear technologies and aiding both Ankara and Islamabad. It may be recalled here that there is a blanket ban on the transfer of technology in the field of nuclear programs at the international level. At the same time, there are also strong punitive measures international nuclear regimes like International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have prescribed for any country which pursues such practices.It may also be recalled here that role of Turkey (under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan) and Pakistan in promoting radicalism and providing sanctuary to terrorist groups is a well known fact. Both are indulging in such activities to promote their respective narrower geopolitical goals. Even China’s role in promoting international terrorism is now surfacing. So a natural question arises, how far are Turkey-Pakistan-China involved clandestinely in producing nuclear weapons which may pose a threat to global and regional security.It should also be pointed out that Turkey being an ally of the West and because of its strategic location near to the border of the then Soviet Union, was under the 'Nuclear Umbrella' of NATO. The first deployment of nuclear weapon to deter the Warsaw Pact took place towards the end of 1960s. However, the growing spat between the US and Turkey over NATO’s role, Erdogan’s geopolitical ambitions in the West Asian region, along with its role in aiding and abetting terrorist groups is sending a strong signal to Washington and NATO to take away the 'nuclear stockpiles' which are located since the Cold War period at the 'Incirlik Air Base' as reported in the New York Times, in a report titled 'Trump Followed His Gut on Syria. Calamity Came Fast'.Although what is sending alarm bells ringing for the global community is the desire on part of authoritarian Erdogan to acquire the same by employing dubious means. As reported in Reuters, an article titled 'Erdogan says it's unacceptable that Turkey can't have nuclear weapons' highlights the nefarious intent of Erdogan who stated “Some countries have missiles with nuclear warheads, not one or two. But (they tell us) we can’t have them. This, I cannot accept.”Analysts are perceiving Erdogan’s desire to become a new 'Khalif' of the Muslim nations is propelling him to acquire nuclear weapons. After moving out of the Western orbit, the Erdogan regime is trying to influence West Asian and Eurasian geopolitics. The Syrian war provided Erdogan with an opportunity to manipulate the geopolitics of the Arab world. The Erdogan regime thinks that nuclear weapons will provide an opportunity for Turkey to assume a preponderant role in the Islamic world. It is in this context that Turkey after becoming a pariah state under Erdogan started aligning with Pakistan, which is known for promoting global terrorism and is involved in clandestinely producing nuclear weapons.Pakistan’s quest for acquiring nuclear weapons is an intrigue mission marked with evil designs and is a perfect example of how clandestinely nuclear weapons are acquired by a nation. It may be underlined here that Pakistan’s role in promoting global terrorism is a well-known fact and possessing a nuclear weapon gives this rogue state traction to blackmail the global community. One may also recall here that China is one of the major allies of Pakistan’s quest for nuclear weapons along with North Korea. This 'unholy nexus' between China and Pakistan is contributing to a growing threat to both the regional and global security order.As per the report of the SIPIRI Year Book 2020, Pakistan possesses '160 deployed warheads'. This makes the security situation grimmer for both South Asia and the global order. At the same time, jihadi extremists, terrorist groups and Army are taking an upper hand in Pakistan’s domestic politics. Along with China, North Korea has also played a vital role in propelling the uncontrolled and unregulated nuclear weapons program of Pakistan. The nexus between China and Pakistan was highlighted by various international non-proliferation bodies from time to time. As reported, China has constructed five nuclear units in Pakistan and the latest one is the Chasma nuclear power plant. The China National Nuclear Corporation has also been been actively involved in the clandestine nuclear weapon program of Pakistan, despite knowing the fact that the IAEA has time and again raised its apprehensions over Pakistan’s nuclear weapon program.The clandestine nexus between China and Pakistan was caught red handed when in February 2020, Indian Navy intercepted a ship going to Pakistan and arriving from China with hardware believed to be used for nuclear industries as was widely reported in the Press. To substantiate the point further, in 2001 United States' Office of the Secretary of Defense published a Report titled 'Proliferation: Threat and Response' where the nuclear nexus between Beijing and Islamabad was highlighted more succinctly. The report adds how China supported Pakistan’s nuclear- related activities like 'plutonium enrichment', 'missile production efforts' and 'Enhanced Pakistan’s missile capabilities' (p. 18). The same report also castigated Pakistan and noted that it “could sell the missiles to other states of concern”(p.13). It may be noted that the apprehensions showed by the United States office of the Secretary of Defense proves to be correct as the highly controversial nuclear scientist A Q Khan who was himself involved in many such clandestine nuclear activities for Pakistan admitted the same while giving an interview to Pakistani newspaper 'The News' on September 12, 2012 . Khan stated that “the then prime minister Benazir Bhutto summoned me (A Q Khan) and named the two countries which were to be assisted and issued clear directions in this regard.” This shows the nefarious intent of Pakistan’s nuclear sector and its official establishment which to a great extent is jeopardising the security and stability of South Asia in particular and Asia in general.On the other hand, China which started demonstrating its nuclear capabilities at the beginning of 1960s is now considered as a formidable nuclear weapon power posing a major security challenge to the Indo-Pacific region along with Asia's security. As has been observed by US Office of the Secretary of Defense in its annual report to the Congress, 'Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020', \"PLA to develop the capability to project power outside China’s borders and immediate periphery to secure the PRC’s growing overseas interests and advance its foreign policy goals.” A recent joint article published by the prestigious journal, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, authored by Hans M. Kristensen and Matt Korda titled 'Nuclear notebook: Chinese nuclear forces' in December 2020 also gives a glaring picture about Chinese nuclear industry. The article states that: “China has produced a stockpile of approximately 350 nuclear warheads, of which roughly 272 are for delivery by more than 240 operational land-based ballistic missiles, 48 sea-based ballistic missiles, and 20 nuclear gravity bombs assigned to bombers. The remaining 78 warheads are intended to arm additional land- and sea-based missiles that are in the process of being fielded”.The above study clearly demonstrates Chinese intent and more or less confirms the US Department of Defense Report which adds that China is modernising its defence force just to achieve its grand imperial objectives rooted in its ancient strategic culture of \"Middle Kingdom Complex”. However, what is more worrisome is China’s role in the illegal proliferation of both nuclear technology along with weapons, causing global concerns. China’s role in promoting nuclear weapon capabilities of its client state Pakistan is well documented and a few aspects have even been discussed above. China is also a major backer to nuclear armed North Korea, and Libya during late Col. Gaddafi’s time, as reports suggest.A closer analysis of the conduct of three countries (China, Pakistan and Turkey) discussed above reflects four basic points that bring a sense of symmetry in their strategic behaviour. These are:Though Turkey strongly pursues its nuclear program citing the need for energy, its real intention is to acquire nuclear weapons which can enhance its bargaining capability in both the Islamic world and the European Union where it has consistently failed to get admission. The NATO bloc has also dumped Turkey in recent years. Similarly, its relations with Russia are also not cordial. It is in this context, to beef up his image, Erdogan has resorted to acquiring nuclear weapons. Similar is the case of both Pakistan and China. In this regard, both Beijing and Islamabad are resorting to nuclear blackmail bargain strategy to achieve their nefarious strategic goals in Asia, Eurasia and, the Indo-Pacific.Both China and Pakistan are also operating in tandem to promote Turkey’s quest for nuclear weapons. As reported in the Chinese official newspaper, People's Daily, China is involved in the construction of “four nuclear reactors”. It may be underlined here that looking at both the Chinese and Turkish conduct over the years in the international arena it is appearing that there is something more to the projected civilian nuclear cooperation. It may also be recalled here that both China and Turkey entered into an air defense cooperation in 2013 and in 2016, both countries signed 'Sino-Turkish Agreement for Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy'. The nexus among China, Turkey and North Korea in promoting nuclear weapon has also been highlighted by a recent report published by the German government in June 2020.It may be noted that Turkey’s efforts to acquire nuclear weapon are not confined to China alone. Over the years, number of news reports have stated clearly that there is growing rapprochement between these two countries in the sphere of the nuclear weaponisation program. Both Ankara and Islamabad in recent years are also trying to build a new kind of alliance by playing the religious card. This is despite the fact that both of them are being blacklisted by West Asian countries for their nefarious activities. It can be underlined that both Turkey and Pakistan are trying to form a new kind of 'rogue alliance'.Pakistan and Turkey's nuclear cooperation can be considered in the light of the overall defense cooperation between the two countries which is going on in full swing in the recent years. During the recent visit of Turkish Foreign Minister in January 2021, both countries signed the '71 point road map' which includes 'defense cooperation'. The covert and overt role of Turkey and Pakistan in promoting a global nexus in the proliferation of nuclear weapon can be evident from a report prepared by David Albright and Corey Hinderstein titled “Uncovering the Nuclear Black Market: Working Toward Closing Gaps in the International Non Proliferation Regime”, prepared for Institute for Nuclear Materials Management (INMM) 45th Annual Meeting. The report adds that the so-called Khan network used Turkey as a base for exporting nuclear technologies. The notorious AQ Khan network, the report adds, started “Workshops in Turkey made the centrifuge motor …. These workshops imported subcomponents from Europe and elsewhere, and they assembled these centrifuge items in Turkey. Under false end-user certificates, these components were shipped to Dubai for repackaging and shipment to Libya.”. One may add here this illegal activity of AQ Khan in carrying out nuclear trade cannot be carried out without the active connivance of Turkish authorities.As reported widely in media, prior to the Foreign Minister of Turkey’s visit to Pakistan, “15th round of Pakistan-Turkey High-Level Military Dialogue Group” took place in the month of December 2020. As reported in the newspapers, during the meeting both sides agreed to further the defense cooperation. There are a number of instances through which one can infer that an illegal nuclear deal is going on between both sides. Analysts are arguing that the authoritarian Erdogan regime is wooing Pakistan in the form of religious identity to get nuclear weapons.What are the geopolitical consequences of the emerging unholy nuclear axis which is currently taking place among China, Pakistan and Turkey? In this regard, it may be recalled here that there are four major trajectories emerging from such nexus. These are:How does India look at these developments in the context of a nexus among China, Pakistan and Turkey? Over the years, both China and Pakistan along with Turkey under Erdogan are posing a strong threat to India’s security. It is in this context India should beef up its own nuclear defense capability to ensure a creditable nuclear deterrence against China, Turkey and Pakistan. At the same time India being a “responsible nuclear power” should also mobilise strong international public opinion through the UN and IAEA to checkmate illegal proliferation of nuclear weapons.To sum up, one may add here that the unholy nexus among Turkey, China and Pakistan is real and poses a strong challenge to global security. The international community along with the existing nuclear regulatory regimes should take strong measures to checkmate this alliance of Beijing, Islamabad and Ankara. As China is being castigated by the international community for its involvement in the Covid-19 pandemic, a similar stand should be taken by the global community by putting China, Pakistan and Turkey under international sanctions.",

The report was made by Framatome, the EDF business that designed the plant’s reactor and remains involved in its operations.\n\nFramatome warned that the plant, a joint venture with China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) that is located around 200 kilometres from Hong Kong, was facing an “imminent radiological threat”.\n\nHere is what we know so far.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED AT TAISHAN?\n\nAccording to CNN, U.S. officials have been investigating the Framatome claims of a leak for the past week.\n\nEDF, which has a minority stake in the plant, said a build-up of krypton and xenon - both inert gases - had affected the primary circuit of Taishan Unit 1, but added that it was a “known phenomenon, studied and provided for in the reactor operating procedures.”\n\nMajority owner CGN also said in a statement that operations at the plant met safety rules.\n\nRadiation levels in the vicinity were still normal on Monday, according to real-time data from the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA).\n\nAccording to CNN, Framatome’s warning included an accusation that NNSA was raising acceptable radiation limits outside the Taishan plant to avoid having to shut it down.\n\nThe regulator did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in a regular briefing the plant was fully compliant with all requirements and operating normally.\n\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS?\n\nNuclear experts have generally played down the risks. CNN cited U.S. officials as saying that the dangers to the public were currently minimal.\n\nLi Ning, a Chinese nuclear scientist based in the United States, told Reuters that CNN was “making a mountain out of a molehill” and that it was unrealistic to expect “zero failure” in the fuel cladding of nuclear projects anywhere in the world.\n\nLi said the media were “often unwilling to put risks into proper perspective”, which he said had effectively killed off the nuclear industry in the west.\n\n“Coal fired power plants can emit and discharge more radioactivity than nuclear power plants,” Li said.\n\nWHY IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVOLVED?\n\nCGN, China’s largest state-owned nuclear company, was placed on a U.S. blacklist in Aug. 2019 for allegedly making efforts to acquire advanced U.S. technology and material for diversion to military uses in China.\n\nThat means that Framatome, which has operations in the United States, would need a waiver from the U.S. government to allow it to help CGN fix technological problems, Li said.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry has said the blacklist is a misuse of export control measures.\n\nWHAT IS TAISHAN’S SAFETY RECORD?\n\nMinor safety issues have been quite frequent at Taishan. In March, inspectors checking a faulty voltmeter in Unit 1 accidentally caused an electrical malfunction that triggered an automatic shutdown, according to NNSA incident records.\n\nIn April, a burst of radioactive gas unexpectedly entered a pipe at Unit 1’s waste gas treatment system just as workers were trying to seal it, also triggering an alarm, NNSA said.\n\nWHAT IS AN “EPR”?\n\nFormerly known as a “European Pressurised Reactor”, the EPR is a “third-generation” nuclear technology that includes enhanced safety features as well as greater generation capacity.\n\nIt was designed by Framatome together with Germany’s Siemens. Its third-generation rivals now include Westinghouse’s AP1000, Russia’s VVER-1200 and China’s Hualong One.\n\nIn 2006, EDF and fellow French nuclear group Areva lost a bid to build four reactors on China’s eastern coast, with China opting for Westinghouse’s model after signing a deal to transfer core technology for use in its own projects.\n\nIn 2007, EDF agreed to build two EPRs at Taishan, which would be 70%-owned by CGN. Construction got underway in 2010. Originally scheduled to be connected to the grid within four years, the first unit wasn’t completed until December 2018.\n\nWHAT NEXT?\n\nEDF did not provide a timeframe for completion of its investigation, nor did U.S. officials, according to the CNN report.\n\nProblems at the Taishan project are unlikely to dent China’s nuclear ambitions, but they underscore the challenges facing foreign reactor developers in a market increasingly dominated by domestic players.\n\nChina fell short on its 2020 nuclear capacity target. Many complained the sector’s expansion was derailed not only by the 2011 Fukushima disaster, but also by the lengthy delays and spiralling costs at foreign-designed projects.\n\nAs it steps up the construction of new plants, China is now expected to depend primarily on its own third-generation Hualong One design, but it is also helping to finance the construction of an EPR project at Britain’s Hinkley Point.

Credit:The New York Times Leaders of the five Central Asian nations that became independent republics after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan — are used to walking a regional tightrope. The area was contested during the so-called Great Game of the 19th century, when the British and Russian empires competed to establish influence and control.\n\nNow a new game is underway. And officials in Central Asia, like many of their counterparts around the world, are hedging their bets when it comes to aligning with Washington or Beijing. Loading Replay Replay video Play video Play video \"I'd like to once again note that we want to see Central Asia as a region of stable development, prosperity and cooperation,\" said Abdulaziz Kamilov, the foreign minister of Uzbekistan. \"And we would really not like to feel on ourselves unfavorable political consequences in relation to some competition in our region between large powers.\" The US State Department released a Central Asia strategy document February 5 that said the top priority was to \"support and strengthen the sovereignty and independence of the Central Asian states\"— a reference to warding off the influence of China and Russia. It is a tough mission for the United States. The nations are in China's and Russia's backyards, and there have been decades of close interactions among them. Xi has made multiple state visits to the countries since he took power in 2012, most recently last year.\n\nThe Trump administration has hit major setbacks in its attempts to build a global coalition against projects by the Chinese government and by Chinese companies. In fact, Britain said on January 28 that it would not ban technology made by Huawei, a Chinese telecom giant, from its high-speed 5G wireless network, despite intense pressure from US officials. Loading Pompeo made London his first stop on a recent six-day trip to Europe and Central Asia, and he said there on January 30 that the Chinese Communist Party was \"the central threat of our times.\" The next day, he spoke about China with leaders in Ukraine. But words go only so far. The Americans fail to present an economical alternative to Huawei. And the Trump administration is discovering that its belligerent approach toward allies has a cost when it comes to China strategy. Withdrawing from the global Paris climate agreement and the landmark Iran nuclear deal, starting trade conflicts with friendly governments and berating members of NATO make those nations less likely to listen to Washington's entreaties on China.\n\nA recent policy report on China by the Centre for a New American Security said \"critical areas of US policy remain inconsistent, uncoordinated, under-resourced and — to be blunt — uncompetitive and counterproductive to advancing US values and interests.\" The United States did not pursue serious partnerships in Central Asia until after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when the Pentagon needed regional bases for the war in Afghanistan. China has taken a different approach. Beijing said it will help build up the region under what it calls the Silk Road Economic Belt, which is part of the larger Belt and Road Initiative, a blanket term for global infrastructure projects that, according to Beijing, amount to $US1 trillion ($1.489 trillion) of investment. The Trump administration said the projects are potential debt traps, but many countries have embraced them.\n\nThe economic liberalisation of Uzbekistan under Mirziyoyev, who took power in 2016 after the death of a longtime dictator, has resulted in greater trade with China. China is Uzbekistan's largest trading partner, and trade totalled almost $US6.3 billion in 2018, a nearly 50 per cent increase from 2017, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. Chinese goods, including Huawei devices, are everywhere in Samarkand, Bukhara, Tashkent and other Uzbek cities. Uzbekistan is also committing to being part of rail and road networks that China is building across Central Asia. Since 2001, China has worked with Central and South Asian nations as well as Russia in a multilateral group, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, to address security issues. China's People's Liberation Army has gained a new foothold in the region, in the form of a base in Tajikistan's Pamir Mountains. For at least three years, Chinese troops have quietly kept watch from two dozen buildings and lookout towers near the Tajik-Chinese border and the remote Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Afghan corridor is a strategic strip of land whose borders were drawn by Britain and Russia during the original Great Game as a buffer zone. The United States had hundreds of troops at an air base in Uzbekistan that it operated with the Uzbeks. But it wants to move the relationship well beyond the military. \"We want private investment, American private investment sector, to flow between our two nations,\" Pompeo said. He added that the United States had committed $US100 million to programs in Uzbekistan last year and that it would give $US1 million to help develop financial markets and another $US1 million to increase trade and \"connectivity\" between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.",

                        "docText": "What struck Wang Wen about Antarctica, beyond the brutality of the December cold, was the scale of U.S. operations in such an inhospitable environment and the American flag fluttering by the sign that marks the geographic South Pole. Observing the academic mission of hundreds of U.S. scientists in a region rich in resource potential, he was determined that China must catch up.The report Wang wrote this summer for the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China in Beijing, where he’s executive dean, reflects China’s growing dilemma as it muscles its way into an international system it didn’t create.For the first time in its long history, China has in President Xi Jinping a leader with a truly global vision. So, inevitably, Beijing looks to the U.S., the sole superpower , for a yardstick as to what that requires—be it a blue water navy or more research stations in Antarctica.Yet Communist Party leaders also recoil at being seen as the next global hegemon and are reluctant to shoulder the expense that goes with it. They studiously avoid the word “superpower” and see the American version of it as ideologically unacceptable and spent.Whether China does become a superpower and whether it could sustain the costs involved are questions that will impact the world for decades. They will shape terms of trade, a changing global order, and issues of war and peace. “We don’t know,” Wang said over dinner a few floors below his institute, when asked what Chinese great power will look like. “Anything but America.”Yet to misquote Leon Trotsky, even if China isn’t interested in becoming a superpower, superpower may be interested in it. The U.S., too, began its journey on the world stage determined not to replicate earlier colonial empires. Today, 11 carrier groups and a network of military bases span the globe to protect its interests.China may be heading down a similar path. An aircraft carrier construction program is underway. Its first overseas military base opened last year, in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa. Spending for diplomatic service is up sharply. Xi’s “Made in China 2025” economic project aims to displace the U.S. as the world’s technological power, while another plan calls for dominance in Artificial Intelligence by 2030.The country raised defense spending from $21 billion in 1990 to $228 billion last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, more than three times Russia’s budget. The ease with which it did so—the military’s share of overall government spending actually fell—suggests China can be any kind of power it wants.Already there are signs a Chinese model for development, based on an authoritarian political system and state-directed market economy, could gain traction against the more liberal ideals long promoted by the U.S. and post-war institutions like the International Monetary Fund. Some countries, including Cambodia, now follow Beijing’s direction, attracted by China’s deep pockets.Still, Beijing’s crackdown on free speech and other social liberties doesn’t suggest a self-confident regime. A budding trade war with the U.S. has helped shave about 20 percent off Chinese equities since January, triggering a domestic debate over whether Xi has already overreached by bidding so openly to challenge the U.S.Consider, too, that the average Chinese remains less wealthy than the average Mexican at a time when the population is already starting to age. Some investors wonder about the health of big Chinese banks, whose lending for decades provided the investment-led growth on which the party relies for its legitimacy. If this is a superpower in the making, it may be a fragile one.To Paul Dibb, a former deputy secretary for intelligence in Australia’s defense department, it’s telling that Beijing spends more on internal security than defense. “China will have to choose not between guns and butter,” he said, “but between guns and elderly care.”Wang, 32, is among the loyalists who’ve come to prominence since Xi took power in 2013. Like his boss (Wang is also the Chongyang Institute’s party secretary), he exudes limitless confidence in China’s future.It took four days to travel from Beijing to Antarctica. On the final leg, flying low over the vast icy expanse, Wang and others sucked oxygen from masks in the plane’s decompressed cabin. He is repelled by stories of colonist-era explorers like Robert Scott, who raced to plant their flags and stake territorial claims. Yet he also admires their “fearless spirit” and willingness to sacrifice.“Should we contemporary Chinese be ashamed?” he wrote on his return, in the Chinese language Global Times.An ice sheet with a mean depth of 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers) has protected Antarctica’s resources from exploration. Still, Wang’s report says that below the surface is an estimated 500 billion tons of coal, as much as 100 billion barrels of oil, and 5 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. Despite a 1959 treaty which freezes all territorial claims, at least for now, Wang sees a “fierce” geopolitical struggle underway. He fears that, without a stronger voice and presence, China will lose out.“President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that China must participate more actively into rule-settings in new areas, including deep sea, polar regions, outer space and the Internet,” his report concludes.In practice, that would mean building infrastructure to accommodate tourists and beefing up Beijing’s research presence, the key determinant of influence in Antarctica’s multinational administration.The U.S. budget request for the Office of Polar Programs in 2019 is $534 million. From 2001 to 2016, according to Wang’s report, China invested 310 million yuan ($45 million) in its Antarctic program. Beijing could easily afford the difference, but Antarctica is just one challenge China faces as it asserts its interests around the globe.In January, China published its first white paper on the other pole, the Arctic, outlining its ambition for a “Polar Silk Road.” It proposes building new-design icebreaker vessels and bases, essential tools in an area with fewer barriers to territorial claims than the southern polar cap.Silk Road is another name for the Belt and Road Initiative, into which China has already sunk hundreds of billions of dollars. In Africa alone, China loaned about $86 billion between 2000 and 2014 to governments and state-owned enterprises, and in 2015 Xi pledged another $60 billion under the initiative. Meanwhile, to match the U.S. on defense spending, China would need to find another $400 billion a year. Even for China, these are large costs.Xi grasps the core lesson of the former Soviet Union’s failure—its over-reliance on military strength, according to David Shambaugh, a professor at George Washington University and author of numerous books on China. Beyond weapons, superpowers require technology, strong economies and soft power influence to sustain themselves. “China understands that,” he said.China has modernized its army while spending a relatively small share of annual GDP—officially as little as 1.5 percent, or 1.9 percent according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Either figure would see China risk criticism from the U.S. for underspending, if it were part of the NATO alliance. Even so, a scorecard run since 1996 by the Rand Corporation, a U.S. research institute, found that last year, for the first time, China would have air power parity with the U.S. in any conflict over Taiwan.The latest budget increases spending on the diplomatic service at twice the rate of the military. More than 500 Confucius Institutes now teach Chinese language and culture across the globe.For all that, China still has few real allies and remains at best a partial superpower, according to Shambaugh. Its soft power is undercut by its militarization of the South China Sea and concerns its offshore infrastructure loans are just debt traps that will bind smaller nations to its will. Its culture, while rich and deep, has little equivalent to Hollywood, or the ideals of individual freedom.“Their military is still regional, they have almost no power projection capability,” said Shambaugh, adding the same is true of diplomacy, where China has yet to take the lead on a major international agreement. “They are really a very self-interested power,” he said. “They’re not interested in shaping the global order.”That isn’t quite right, according to Henry Wang, founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. True, China doesn’t want to destroy the world order that the U.S. shaped, as it has benefited from it. But it does want to create what he calls globalization 2.0, by adding new international structures including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.“People get scared” by China’s size, according to Wang. China just wants globalization that’s more inclusive, he says.“There’s not a magnanimous bone in the Chinese body politic. It’s all about China,” counters Jim McGregor, chairman for greater China at the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. “Name a country that’s a true friend of China.”More worrying for China’s global ambitions are signs its economic engine could stall. China would, for example, be the first superpower to start getting old before it got rich. According to United Nations projections, its 1.4 billion-strong population is likely to decline and age sharply from as soon as 2023. The number of working age Chinese has already begun to shrink.“I can’t find a single example of a superpower growing when its population was falling,” said Zhang Jian, associate professor at Peking University’s School of Government. The British Empire and the U.S. rose to prominence when their populations were exploding. Xi “needs to take care about the domestic situation and worry less about being a great power,” said Zhang.Nor is China as flush as commonly assumed. Adjusted for purchasing power parity, which accounts for the greater buying power of a dollar spent domestically, China has a larger gross domestic product than the U.S. But that’s a poor measure of international buying power, where dollars are just dollars, according to Tom Orlik, chief economist at Bloomberg Economics.“One way to measure the additional money China has to spend around the world is to look at nominal GDP in U.S. dollar terms. In the five years before the financial crisis, that averaged close to 23 percent annual growth,” said Orlik. “In the last five years, it’s averaged 7 percent—including a year of zero growth in 2016.”China’s GDP per capita is around $9,000 compared to $60,000 for the U.S.. That could mean more room for catch-up growth, but to get there China will have to avoid the middle income trap that keeps many emerging economies stuck below a GDP per capita of around $15,000. To date, no large economy has made the transition without liberalizing.Western economic laws don’t apply, according to Xi loyalists; the strategic smarts of the party will let China blow through the middle income trap—even without the independent judiciary and property rights that fostered innovation elsewhere.Xi has urged China’s scientists to trust a socialist system that stunned the world by producing nuclear and space programs during the 1960s. “By tightening our belts and gritting our teeth, we built ‘two bombs and one satellite!’” Xi said in an April speech. “The next step is to do the same with science and technology.”Under Xi, the party has swallowed the more technocratic government, taking over many of its functions. Major companies have party cells within them. That’s a good thing, in the view of the president’s followers, because it ensures control by a 90 million-strong organization that has developed as a relatively efficient meritocracy.Criticism of China’s heavy corporate debt burden at home—about two and a half times GDP last year—and potential defaults on white elephant infrastructure projects overseas are misplaced, the thinking goes. That’s because clever party officials choose the projects that get big loans. APCO’s McGregor points out the U.S. itself relied on central planning to supercharge its economy, in World War Two.“We’re kind of full of ourselves,” he said of the West. “We talk all this stuff about the superiority of free markets, but how did the U.S. become an economic superpower?”Xi’s consolidation of power has some worried that the scope for bad decisions that go unchallenged is growing. At the National Museum of China in Beijing, a permanent exhibit tells China’s history since the 1839-42 Opium War as a morality tale of colonial oppression, followed by uninterrupted party success. It skips over Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, which caused tens of millions of deaths and vast economic damage.Joerg Wuttke, until last year president of the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, notes that sycophancy tends to grow with one-man-rule. He worries also that the party is draining talent from the very bureaucracy on which China’s leaders are depending to deliver sustained prosperity.“The party that was so successful for the last 30 years,” says Wuttke, “is the same party that left behind a trail of destruction for the previous 30 years.”All of this, according to Wang Wen, is to fundamentally misunderstand China by trying to fit it into western experience. He cites the doom-laden warnings of Chinese over-leverage and over-planning that have proved wrong for decades.“Our country has entered a very interesting phase that the Western social sciences can’t explain,” said Wang, singling out conventional economics as especially inept. “If you use Western theory, you cannot understand China’s foreign policy.”",

(But) I mean if they do, what options do those countries have other than to protest?\"\n\nSeveral countries in Southeast Asia have already started moving closer to China as US influence in the region fades, including a startling about-face by Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017.\n\nBut the country to watch as a litmus test of China's growing influence in Southeast Asia is Vietnam, Storey said, which has emerged as a surprising US ally in recent years.\n\nIn 2017, Vietnam built a closer defense and security relationship with the US while standing as perhaps the last major opposition to China in the neighboring sea. A US aircraft carrier will be visiting the country in 2018 for the first time since the Vietnam War.\n\nStorey said any moves by Vietnam towards Beijing would be stunning.\n\n\"That would be a key indication that China is winning in the region and that Southeast Asian countries were making concessions to China,\" he said.\n\nEast Asia: Cracks in US influence\n\nThe vast majority of American power in Asia, both military and diplomatic, is centered on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn 2017, the North Korean government announced it had developed missiles capable of hitting the mainland United States , sparking a war of words between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump as well as conflicting views inside Washington over how to resolve the crisis.\n\nHow the standoff ends could well determine the future of US power in Asia, but John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at Harvard Kennedy School, told CNN the event itself shows the cracks in American influence.\n\n\"The current North Korean nuclear crisis is showing the considerable effort that the US has to make to project its power,\" he said.\n\nIt isn't just the impotence of the US to stop North Korea attaining nuclear weapons. Repeated threats of military action which could come at the expense of South Korea have caused concerns among the close US ally, Park said.\n\n\"The pillar of the decades-old assurance that the US would defend Seoul as if it were Los Angeles is appearing to shake,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threats of potential military intervention in North Korea are likely to be tested in coming years as well. Park said further missile testing is likely in 2018, as well as a possible atmospheric nuclear test by the North Koreans.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump to UN: 'Rocket Man' on a suicide mission Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump to UN: 'Rocket Man' on a suicide mission 02:23\n\nNeighboring countries will be watching the US carefully and any rash conflict sparked by Washington will be laid straight at the White House's door. \"The credibility of US leadership as a provider of global stability would erode,\" Park said.\n\nBut while international attention is focused on the Korean Peninsula, China could seek to test US influence in Asia through a completely separate flashpoint in East Asia.\n\nIn his speech at the 19th Party Congress in October, Xi Jinping did not mince his words when saying the national reunification of Taiwan with the mainland was a vital part of his plan for China.\n\nMainland Chinese authorities announced in early 2018 they would be opening new air routes over the Taiwan Straits, in an area close to the island itself, without consulting Taipei's government.\n\n\"The one thing that has never changed (for Beijing) is the Taiwan position,\" Xu Guoqi, Kerry Group professor at the University of Hong Kong, told CNN.\n\n\"They always claimed Taiwan was part of China ... so now as China becomes more assertive, more powerful, as the Americans pull back, Beijing might do something that might be a surprise.\"\n\nAny moves by China against Taiwan would be a test for US influence, as Washington has been a close ally of Taipei for decades.\n\nIf American promises to defend the island from Beijing aggression weren't honored, Xu said, the backdown could shatter US influence and alliances in Asia.\n\nSouth Asia: Military focus shifting\n\nBarely two weeks into 2018, Indian Army chief Gen. Bipin Rawat said it was time for India to shift its defensive focus to the northern border it shares with China.\n\n\"The country is capable of handling China's assertiveness. China is a powerful country, but we are not a weak nation,\" he said in New Delhi on January 12, according to the Indian Express.\n\nThe comments infuriated Beijing, spurring a series of rebukes from the Chinese Foreign Ministry and even editorials in state media publications.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Relations with India better than ever Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Relations with India better than ever 07:17\n\nBut Bharat Karnad, research professor in national security studies at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, said the repositioning was necessary and long overdue.\n\n\"We are shifting our military focus from Pakistan to China. This is something we should done 30 years ago,\" he said, adding further tensions on the Chinese/Indian border such as the 2017 standoff at Doklam were inevitable.\n\nAccording to Rawat, India and several other countries in Asia, including Japan, were already treating the US as a \"fading power,\" who could no longer be relied on for defense purposes.\n\n\"It could manifest itself in the future via Asian countries and especially India and Japan cooperating and collaborating further on their security objectives,\" he said.\n\nOther countries in South Asia have anticipated the new paradigm in a different way, choosing to make definitive moves closer to the government in Beijing.\n\nPakistan is a close part of China's grand One Belt One Road infrastructure initiative which will be unfolding in Asia over the coming years as Beijing sponsors projects across the region with an aim to recreate the original Silk Road.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, former Pakistan Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said she didn't believe her country had to pick between the US or China, but added Beijing had been a long-term partner for Pakistan.\n\n\"(China is) perhaps the only real strategic partner Pakistan has had, not from today or the last five years, but for the last four decades. With them, we have a complete alignment of interest,\" she said.\n\nIn January, the US confirmed it would be suspending an estimated $1 billion in security assistance to Pakistan over what it sees as a failure by the Pakistani government to adequately clamp down on terror groups within its borders.\n\nElsewhere, Myanmar's controversial State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi recently visited Beijing again to a warm reception, while the Sri Lanka the government announced it had granted a Chinese company a 99-year lease on a newly constructed port.\n\nDespite India's neighbors Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar working closely with China, Karnad said Delhi had one advantage which would hold Beijing at bay for the near future at least.\n\n\"(China) cannot afford to lose the Indian market,\" he said. \"If it upsets India too much, it can shut off the Indian market to Chinese goods, the Chinese economy takes a big hit ... Things are far more difficult for China than many people in the West make out.\"\n\nAustralia: Deft diplomacy required\n\nIt's been a rough year for Australia diplomatically, caught in complicated and fractious relationships with both US President Donald Trump and the Chinese government.\n\nIn the second half of the year, China and Australia regularly clashed over allegations of interference by Beijing in domestic Australian politics, allegations the Chinese vehemently denied.\n\nIn January, Australian International Development Minister Concetta Fierravanta-Wells told local media China's aid in the Pacific was just creating \"useless\" buildings and \"roads to nowhere.\"\n\nHugh White, professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University, says Australia is still trapped in the mantra which has defined its diplomatic choices for a decade: \"Australia doesn't have to choose between the United States and China.\"\n\nEven the new Australian foreign policy white paper published at the end of 2017 makes little reference to the possibility of a reduced US role in the Asia region.\n\n\"Australia tangibly supports the deep engagement of the United States in the economic and security affairs of the region, which has been and continues to be essential to the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific,\" the document says.\n\nBut White warned that over the next three years, trapped between an increasingly aggressive China and a disinterested White House, Canberra could be caught unprepared for a new Asia.\n\n\"Australia doesn't have a policy on this, it just has a series of hopes,\" he said.\n\nWith Australia hugely reliant on the United States for its defense, any breakdown of US influence or presence in the Asia region could leave the island nation militarily adrift, White said.\n\nTo complicate matters, Australia looks likely to see a change in government before 2021, with the current government under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull broadly unpopular across polls.\n\nThere's no indication as yet whether a new Labor government would change its policy to China or the United States.\n\nMichael Fullilove, executive director of Sydney's Lowy Institute, doesn't agree with White that China is guaranteed to assume the leadership of the Asia region, but added navigating the coming years would take deft diplomacy for Australia.\n\n\"What Australia needs to do is hedge ... by seeking to play an active role (diplomatically), by strengthening our connections with other countries. The more we can strengthen our connections with India, Indonesia and Japan, the harder it is for Asia to be dominated by one particular state,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Fullilove said Australia needs to work to keep the US engaged in the region while cooperating with China when it is in Canberra's interests to do so.\n\n\"That's a very ambitious foreign policy I just sketched out -- the question in a lot of minds is, 'is the volatile Australian political system capable of it? Will it prioritize foreign policy, does it have the wherewithal to carry it off?'\" he said.",

                        "docText": "Slide in relations since 2013, could spark future conflict, says former envoy to Beijing\n\nMismatched expectations and “misperceptions”, especially over India’s concerns over the Belt and Road Initiative and China’s view of India-U.S. ties, lie at the root of deteriorating relations between Delhi and Beijing, and could lead to an “antagonistic rivalry” and even future confrontation, says a new paper by former Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale.\n\nAlso read: India, China should create ‘enabling conditions’ to settle border dispute, says Wang Yi\n\nOutlining a consistent downslide in ties particularly since 2013, when Chinese President Xi Jinping was elected President and 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, Mr. Gokhale, has suggested that both sides need to build a more realistic assessment of each other before “tackling individual issues of concern”, like the boundary or trade.\n\n“Both countries view themselves as civilizational powers and expect others to acknowledge this fact. Misperceptions often lead to one country ascribing intentions to the actions or behaviour of the other country that might not have been the latter’s intention, thus creating mistrust. Hence, going forward, both sides may need to rework their basic perceptions of the other side and reach a new perspective before tackling individual issues of concern,” Mr. Gokhale has written in the paper ‘The Road from Galwan: Future of India-China Relations’, published by Carnegie India.\n\nIt is the first such detailed account of bilateral relations since the former Foreign Secretary (2018-2020) and former Ambassador to China (2016-2017), who was a key interlocuter during the Doklam standoff in 2017, retired last year.\n\nAlso read: Editorial | Dangerous impasse: On India-China border row\n\nMr. Gokhale writes that China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was viewed in New Delhi as a lack of sensitivity towards India’s territorial concerns in Jammu and Kashmir, and its primacy in South Asia.\n\n“There was no consultation between China and India over the BRI,” says Mr. Gokhale, adding that “Perhaps the Chinese assumed that India would align and dovetail its plans with the BRI. When China declared the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) a flagship project, it became difficult for India to associate with the BRI.”\n\nHowever, he said China attributes New Delhi’s rejection of the BRI, and its closer ties to the U.S. to “right-wing or Hindu nationalist pressure.”\n\n“Beijing appears to think that the Modi government is more assertive, less sensitive to China’s core concerns, and more likely to side with China’s rivals. It does not regard its policies or actions as having given proper cause for the Indian side to consider China as a strategic threat,” the paper explains. It then quotes several Chinese scholars and publications to say that “China’s leaders felt that while they had done nothing detrimental to India’s interests, India was responding in ways that could be detrimental to them.”\n\nMeanwhile India’s membership of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), that is due to hold its first summit with U.S. President Biden, Japanese Premier Suga, Australian Premier Morrison and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, is interpreted in Beijing to mean that “India is part of the U.S. containment initiative”.\n\n“From India’s perspective, China’s push into the Doklam plateau…appeared to question the very basis of the Rajiv Gandhi-Deng Xiaoping consensus on the peaceful handling of disputes,” he writes, saying the standoff in 2017 “brought matters to a head”.\n\nMr. Gokhale says that while the killings of soldiers at Galwan in 2020 marks an “implacable decline” in India-China ties, the decline is long standing. He lists Chinese aggression at the LAC from 2013, its blocking of UN listings for Pakistan-based terrorists, opposition to India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (2016), failure to address the trade deficit with India and failure to keep promises of bringing in $20 billion in investment to India, as factors.\n\nThe paper concludes that discussions after LAC disengagement at present could be “the final chance” for cooperation between the two countries.\n\n“If not, a new phase of antagonistic rivalry may be starting, with the countries sliding into possible confrontation as the strategic periphery of China collides with the strategic backyard of India in the Indian Ocean region,” Mr. Gokhale writes.",

We have issues, we have ideas agreed upon. I think we have to review all the agreements we had with China. We have to review them and see what is due,\" Nasheed told an international news agency hours after Solih unseated Yameen which seemed unthinkable even on the polling day.These remarks are unlikely to please Beijing which had invested heavily in Maldives. It took over 24 hours to congratulate Solih.\"China and Maldives enjoy traditional friendship and in recent years the two countries maintained sound momentum and conducted mutual beneficial cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road and achieved outstanding outcomes,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in a response to a question in Beijing on Monday.“We are willing to work with the Maldives to consolidate our traditional friendship and deepen our cooperation to the benefit of the people of both the nations,\" Geng noted.In response to another question, Geng hoped that the new government will respect the FTA signed between China and Maldives, during Yameen’s tenure.“As to the FTA signed between China and Maldives…we hope the Maldives will maintain consistency and stability of their policy and create an enabling environment for Chinese enterprises operation in the Maldives”.In its congratulatory message, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it respected the choice of the people of Maldives, and hoped that the country “can maintain stability and development”.China and Maldives had signed a FTA last September. “China will work with Maldives to ensure the sound implementation of FTA and expand trade and investment cooperation between both the sides for the greater benefit and development of people of both the nations,” Geng observed.Maldives, a small economy heavily reliant on tourism, is one of the most at-risk countries of any involved with the BRI to the distress of debt, said the Center for Global Development, a Washington DC-based think-tank tracking the initiative.Chinese loans for projects already account for around 70 percent of the Maldives’ national debt. In 2014, China began to develop major infrastructure projects. One is a bridge linking the capital Male to a nearby island. The other is an expansion of the capital’s airport, a project awarded to a Chinese company in 2014. The Maldives has also leased an uninhabited island (Feydhoo Finolhu) to a Chinese enterprise for 50 years at a price of around $4 million, with plans to develop infrastructure for tourism. China is also constructing a 25-storey apartment complex and hospital in the Maldives.The Maldives’ economy has grown by an average of 6 percent a year for the last five years, buoyed by tourism and construction, according to Fitch.",

There were no arrests.\n\nDespite the crackdown, hundreds of Maldivians headed to polling booths before voting began in the capital Male.\n\n\"There is a lot of enthusiasm. Voters lined up to vote despite overcast weather,\" MDP party worker Shauna Aminath said.\n\nMr Yameen has borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from China to build up infrastructure, alarming the nation's long-time backer India.\n\nRelated Story Maldives heads to polls amid criticism over fairness of vote under President Yameen\n\nRelated Story Maldives' former president Nasheed vows to renegotiate China loans if opposition wins\n\nThe European Union has said it is ready to impose travel bans and asset freezes on individuals \"if the situation does not improve\", while the United States has warned it would \"consider appropriate measures\" against those undermining democracy in the country of 1,200 islands.\n\nSome 262,000 people in the archipelago - famed for its white beaches and blue lagoons - can vote in an election from which independent international monitors have been barred.\n\nOnly a handful of foreign media have been allowed in.\n\nThe Asian Network for Free Elections, a foreign monitoring group, said the campaign was heavily tilted in favour of the 59-year-old Yameen.\n\nThe network said it did not expect a fair contest.\n\n\"In the absence of any scrutiny (of the elections) or pressure (on the government), sombre events surely loom ahead for the people of Maldives,\" it said on the eve of the vote.\n\nIn February, Mr Yameen alarmed the international community by imposing a state of emergency, suspending the Constitution and sending troops to stop members of Parliament who were trying to impeach him.\n\nThe chief justice and a judge of the Supreme Court were jailed along with Mr Yameen's half-brother Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, president for 30 years until 2008 and the man who helped Mr Yameen come to power in 2013.\n\nThe United Nations said the arrest of judges was an \"outright assault on democracy\".\n\nSilencing dissent\n\nMr Mohamed Nasheed, the Maldives' first democratically elected president from 2008-12 but now in exile, called last Friday for the international community to reject the election results.\n\n\"Mathematically, it is not possible for Yameen to win because all opposition parties are united against him,\" said Mr Nasheed, who is based in Sri Lanka.\n\n\"But the results they will announce will be different to what is actually in the ballot boxes.\"\n\nMr Nasheed was forced to withdraw from the presidential race after the Maldives election commission disqualified him because of a 2015 terrorism conviction.\n\nThe UN said the conviction and 13-year jail sentence were politically motivated, but Mr Yameen's government has refused to abide by the UN ruling.\n\nThe MDP has named veteran lawmaker Ibrahim Mohamed Solih as its alternative candidate. The relatively unknown Solih has Nasheed's backing. There are no other candidates.\n\nMr Solih has struggled for visibility with the electorate because the media is fearful of falling foul of heavy-handed decrees and reporting restrictions.\n\nThe government has used \"vaguely worded laws to silence dissent and to intimidate and imprison critics\", some of whom have been assaulted and even murdered, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nEligible voters in neighbouring Sri Lanka and India, along with those in Malaysia and Britain, are entitled to vote on Sunday. The results are expected by midday on Monday.\n\nA candidate must secure 50 per cent of the vote to win outright, failing which there would be a run-off three days later.",

It also suspended 56 lawyers from attending court last year for demanding to uphold the rule of law.\n\n“The space for civil society has not shrunk. It does not exist any more,” Shahindha Ismail, the executive director at Maldives Democracy Network, told Reuters.\n\nYameen has disregarded calls from the United Nations, several western countries and India for an amicable solution to the lingering political crisis. In 2016, the Maldives quit the Commonwealth group of nations, which threatened to suspend the country after it criticized the government for rights abuses.",

Most went to Chinese firms and are feared to have left the country in debt.During a five-year building spree, China built a sea bridge connecting the capital city of Male to the main airport on another island and is developing the airport itself as well as building mass housing on land reclaimed from the sea.But Finance Minister Ibrahim Ameer told reporters during a visit to New Delhi that his officials had spend the first week in office trying to reconcile loans that the previous government took for these projects and the sovereign guarantees that it gave for them.“We believe that most of these projects are at inflated prices , and so we are looking at them,” Ameer said.But he said the government could not go back on the contracts because many of these, including the bridge, were already completed.“We cannot do much in terms of renegotiation but going forward our objective would be to reduce the cost of our infrastructure projects,” he said.One of the projects was a hospital in Male awarded to China which had already run up a cost $140 million, far more than a rival offer $54 million that was originally made, Ameer said.China has built ports, bridges and highways in countries stretching from Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and its ally Pakistan as part of its Belt and Road Initiative for a trade and transit corridor across Asia and into Europe.But of late it has faced criticism that many of its massive projects costing millions of dollars are pushing the smaller countries into debt.India, which has been traditional partner for most of the South Asian countries, has in addition viewed the expansive Chinese diplomacy as aimed at securing an outpost in some of the island nations such as Sri Lanka and the Maldives Taiwan voters embrace China-friendly oppositionMaldives’ foreign minister Abdulla Shahid said he had assured Indian leaders that his country wanted the best of ties with its immediate neighbors and would return to an “India First” policy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended Solih’s inauguration and said India stood ready to help the country tide over its financial difficulties.China has rejected allegations it was driving the Maldives to debt and said it hopes the new government will continue with policies to attract investment.",

According to the election law, it must release the official results within seven days of the election.\n\nThe election outcome surprised many, given opposition warnings that the voting could be rigged by Yameen.\n\nSince getting elected in 2013, Yameen had cracked down on political dissent, jailing rivals — including his half brother and the Maldives’ first democratically elected president — and Supreme Court justices following allegedly flawed trials, while forcing some into exile. He also consolidated power by exerting control over the courts, bureaucracy, the police and the military.\n\nSolih, 56, was a democracy activist during decades of autocratic rule in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation and a former parliamentary majority leader. He became the Maldivian Democratic Party’s presidential candidate after its other top figures were jailed or exiled by Yameen’s government.\n\nParty leader and former President Mohamed Nasheed, in exile in Sri Lanka, had hoped to run again but was disqualified because of an outstanding prison sentence in the Maldives.\n\nIndia and China, jostling for greater influence in the Indian Ocean region, had been watching the election closely.\n\nThe European Union didn’t send election observers because the Maldives failed to meet conditions for monitoring, and few foreign media were allowed into the country to cover the vote. The U.S., which earlier threatened sanctions if the elections were not free and fair, urged calm while the election results were being finalized.\n\nThe Maldives became a multiparty democracy in 2008 after decades of autocratic rule.

We are a family, we may quarrel and we may have arguments but in the end, we will sit down and resolve it,\" the diplomat said.He claimed that the Maldives has taken a number of projects to India for finance \"but we did not receive the necessary finance.\"China, which looks at Maldives as a major participant in its 21st century Maritime Silk Road plan in the Indian Ocean, has made heavy investments in the nation of islands which has 26 tropical atolls and 1,000 small islands.China has put up a staunch defence of Maldives President Abdullah Yameen, stonewalling international pressure and enabling him to stay in power during the current crisis.The picturesque Indian Ocean archipelago was plunged into chaos early last month when the Supreme Court called for the release of nine imprisoned opposition politicians, ruling that their trials were politically motivated and flawed.The government refused to implement the ruling.Yameen imposed a state of emergency and arrested apex court judges and former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.Opposition party leaders in Maldives alleged that China is tacitly backing Yameen, which emboldened him to resort to unconstitutional actions like arresting Supreme Court judges.Former president Mohamed Nasheed who was in exile abroad had called for Indian intervention in Maldives to save the democracy in the island nation. He had alleged that China is indulging in land grabbing, threatening not just the Maldives, but the peace and the stability of the entire region.Faisal said Maldives will not allow any foreign military establishments.\"Our government has made it very clear that we are not going to allow any kind of military establishments or military undertakings in the Maldives. Not for China, not for any other countries,\" he said.More than 70 per cent of the Maldives' foreign debt is owed to China, but Faisal said it was not having trouble making payments, adding that the country had taken some concessional loans to pay as its tourism market expanded.\"Right now, it's only seven islands that Chinese have invested in, in the tourism sector. For a country with such capacity as China I think it is a very low number - it should be more than that.\"China had expressed interest in building a port in the Maldives, Faisal said, but there was no confirmed plan at present.",

India to send envoy, backed by its military, to release judges & pol. detainees inc. Prez. Gayoom. We request a physical presence.\n\n2. The US to stop all financial transactions of Maldives regime leaders going through US banks. — Mohamed Nasheed (@MohamedNasheed) February 6, 2018 Report\n\nIn a statement, Mr Nasheed added: \"President Yameen has illegally declared martial law and overrun the state. We must remove him from power.\"\n\nMr Nasheed was an opposition leader under a former government and became the country's first democratically elected leader in 2008, but was ousted and jailed in 2012. He is currently thought to be in neighbouring Sri Lanka.\n\nA Maldives minister to the UN, Jeffrey Salim Waheed, called his intervention \"treason\" and \"the single biggest attempt to undermine the Maldives sovereignty\".\n\nWhat has been happening?\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court ordered the release of a group of opposition politicians. It also ruled that Mr Nasheed's trial, held in 2015, had been unconstitutional.\n\nThe country's police commissioner said he would enforce the court's ruling - in response, the government of President Yameen sacked him.\n\nThe army has now been ordered to resist any attempt to impeach or remove President Yameen.\n\nPolice arrested Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and another judge, Ali Hameed, hours after the government declared a state of emergency.\n\nFormer President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the opposition, was detained at his home.\n\nIn a video posted online, the ex-president addressed his supporters (in Divehi), saying that he had not \"done anything to warrant arrest\" while urging them to \"remain strong\".\n\nThe state of emergency allows security forces to make arrests, and means public gatherings are banned.\n\nThe opposition Jumhooree Party posted footage of soldiers at an opposition building.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, President Yameen said that judges had been plotting to overthrow him.\n\n\"I had to declare a national emergency because there was no other way to investigate these judges,\" he said in a televised address. \"We had to find out how thick the plot or coup was.\"\n\nMaldives media face closure and cyber-attacks\n\nBy BBC Monitoring\n\nMedia outlets in the Maldives have been affected as the country remains in a state of emergency.\n\nConcerns over media freedom arose last week when the Maldives Broadcasting Commission warned that private TV stations would be shut down if their coverage was deemed to pose a \"threat\" to \"national security\".\n\nOn the day the emergency was declared, the Maldives Independent news website tweeted: \"Our website is under attack and currently inaccessible. Timing of attack coincided with State of Emergency declaration in #Maldives. We are currently unable to report on our website.\"\n\nAs of 6 February the website appears to be unavailable. The outlet said on Twitter that its website was \"still under attack\" but added that they would \"continue live tweeting\".\n\nRaajjeTV, an opposition-aligned station also indicated that a shutdown was \"imminent\", adding that they would \"continue to work for the people of the Maldives till the last minute. We have no security.\"\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has said that \"authorities in the Maldives must immediately stop trying to exert control over the media and access to information\" and \"abide by its constitutional commitment to the freedom of speech\".\n\nWhat does this mean for tourists?\n\nThe political crisis comes during the country's peak tourism season when tens of thousands of foreigners visit the Maldives' tropical beaches.\n\nChina, the United States, India and the UK are among those issuing warnings to travellers in the Maldives.\n\nThe UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said British nationals in the capital, Malé, should \"exercise caution and avoid any protests or rallies\", but that outlying islands and resorts - and the international airport - were not affected.\n\nTourism was worth $2.7bn (£1.9bn) to the Maldivian economy in 2016. It is the biggest industry in the country - home to just 400,000 people - and could be hit hard if the crisis worsens and puts people off travelling.",

                        "docText": "'Profoundly concerned by attempts to spread misguided and unsubstantiated information to propagate hatred towards India', says Govt.\n\nAbout a fortnight since Maldives’s ex-President Abdulla Yameen walked free, after the Supreme Court overturned his conviction in a money-laundering case, the ‘India Out’ campaign in the island nation has intensified, with the former strongman now leading it.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Yameen’s Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM) said the leader would travel to the atolls to step up the ongoing campaign resisting “Indian boots on the ground” in the Indian Ocean Archipelago, even as the ruling administration denies any Indian military presence. Images of Mr. Yameen and his supporters, attired in a red t-shirt with ‘India Out’ printed in bold font, are circulating on social media, along with the ‘#IndiaOut’ hashtag.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday the Government of Maldives said it was “profoundly concerned” by attempts to spread “misguided and unsubstantiated information to propagate hatred towards India”. Calling India “one of the closest bilateral partners of the Maldives”, the Government attributed the campaign to a “small group of individuals and a few political personalities”.\n\n“Spreading hatred and making false allegations regarding bilateral ties with neighbouring countries not only tarnishes the relations with trusted allies who extends consistent support to the Maldivian people, but also affect the safety and security of their citizens in Maldives, and Maldivians living abroad,” the Government’s statement said.\n\nThis is the second such statement issued by Male in recent weeks. On November 17, the Government “strongly rejected” attempts to spread “false information” criticising its ties with India, its “closest ally and trusted neighbour”.\n\nIndia-Maldives relations deteriorated considerably when the Yameen administration was in power from 2013 to 2018. Significantly, tensions rose over Mr. Yameen’s ultimatum to New Delhi to withdraw two Indian helicopters from the strategically important Laamu and Addu atolls. Mr. Yameen’s perceived China tilt during that time also made New Delhi apaprehensive.\n\nFollowing President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s election in September 2018, his Government declared an “India first” foreign policy, resetting ties emphatically . In an open acknowledgement his Government’s India-centric foreign policy, Mr. Solih told The Hindu in a January 2021 interview that the Maldives “makes no apology” for close ties with India.\n\nSpeaker and former President Mohamed Nasheed, a party colleague of Mr. Solih and an influential voice in the Maldives, has earlier said India is the “single most important country” for the Maldives, while accusing is political opponents of “xenophobia”.\n\nCritics of the Government’s India relations, however, said it was Indian “military presence” that they were wary of. Speaking to The Hindu from Male, opposition parliamentarian and PPM vice-president Mohamed Saeed said: “We are not against India or the people of India. Our people are heavily into Bollywood, we love Indian cuisine. That is not the issue. There are reports of Indian military presence in the atolls and the Government is not clarifying this,” he said, adding: “We oppose military presence of any foreign country – be it India, China or whoever else.”\n\nObserving that Mr. Yameen was only “giving leadership” to the \"concerns\" of citizens, Mr. Saeed slammed the Government over its Uthuru Thila Falhu (UTF) harbour development deal with India, signed in February 2021. “There is no transparency, and the government is reluctant to reveal the terms of the agreement in Parliament, despite having a majority in the House. The BJP leadership in India and the [ruling] MDP are messing up bilateral ties. We are not on the right course,” said Mr. Saeed, who was Minister of Economic Development in Mr. Yameen’s Government.\n\nAt the time of the signing of the UTF pact in February this year, Maldivian Defence Minister Mariya Didi termed the project — for which Male made multiple requests even during Mr. Yameen’s term — “vital” to the “effective functioning” of the Maldivian Coast Guard. Ms. Didi has said that the relationship between the Maldives and India today is “stronger than ever”.",

These concerns are particularly relevant as the Indo-Pacific region puts its mind to supply chains resilience and diversification in the post-coronavirus period,” he added.\n\nSupply chains\n\nReferring to the “Supply Chains Resilience Initiative” (SCRI) that India is working on along with Japan and Australia, Mr. Shringla also said India, along with G-20 partners is considering a proposal to waive debt repayments from smaller countries for 2020 at least. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the G-20 summit, being hosted virtually by Saudi Arabia on November 21-22.\n\nMr. Shringla was in London for the final leg of his trip to France, Germany and U.K. He has discussed India’s Indo-Pacific policy at each of the stops, as well as recent progress made by the Quad countries including Australia, India, Japan and U.S. when Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar met his counterparts in Tokyo last month. He also referred to Indo-U.S. “2+2” talks in Delhi, where discussions on the Indo-Pacific policy were at the top of the agenda, and the Malabar naval exercises, that began on Tuesday, which include all Quad countries.\n\nIn particular, the Foreign Secretary said the Indo-Pacific had come into focus because of several factors, including the shift in global trade from the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific, that sees about 65% of world trade and contributes 60% of global GDP. He also said pointedly that “the rise of China” was another factor for the focus.\n\nGerman backing\n\nMr. Shringla said Germany is the third European country, after France and the Netherlands to release a strategy for the Indo-Pacific regions that spans the oceans from the Eastern coast of the African continent to the U.S. West coast, adding that the policy shared India’s “principles” on ensuring fair competition, avoiding over-indebtedness of recipient countries and transparency and sustainability.\n\n“The U.K., we hope and expect, will be next on the list, and too will finalise its Indo-Pacific strategy soon. Given this country’s characteristic wisdom and prodigious institutional memory, we hope too that the UK’s strategy will approximate India’s own and long-standing Indo-Pacific vision,” Mr. Shringla concluded.",

Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea.\n\n“Great to meet with my good friend and a great friend of Australia, Indian PM Narendra Modi during my visit to the U.S.,” Mr. Morrison tweeted.\n\n“A wide-ranging and productive discussion ahead of the first in-person Quad meeting as we look to further deepen the partnership between our two countries,” Mr. Morrison said.\n\nPrime Minister Modi in a tweet said, \"It is always wonderful to interact with my good friend, PM @ScottMorrisonMP. We had wide-ranging deliberations on strengthening cooperation in the fields of commerce, trade, energy and more.\" According to the MEA statement, in their meeting, Mr. Modi and Mr. Morrison reviewed the ongoing negotiations on a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) and welcomed the visit to India by former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott as Mr. Morrison’s Special Trade Envoy for India, and noted the commitment of both sides to achieve an early harvest announcement on an interim agreement by December 2021.\n\nThey underlined the need for the international community to address the issue of climate change on an urgent basis as Prime Minister Modi highlighted the need for a broader dialogue on environment protection, it said, adding that both the leaders also discussed possibilities of providing clean technologies.\n\nAlso Read A climate change narrative that India can steer\n\nMr. Modi and Mr. Morrison agreed that “as two vibrant democracies in the region, the two countries needed to work closer together to overcome the challenges in the post-pandemic world, inter alia to enhance supply chain resilience,” the MEA said.\n\n“Both leaders lauded the immense contribution of the Indian diaspora to Australia’s economy and society, and discussed ways to enhance people to people ties,” the statement added.\n\nPrime Minister Modi also invited Mr. Morrison to visit India.\n\n“The Prime Minister mentioned that the Indian community was very well looked after during the COVID-19 crisis in Australia. He especially mentioned that to the Prime Minister and there was an appreciation of the contribution of the Indian diaspora in Australia,” Mr. Shringla said.\n\nEarlier, Office of Prime Minister Modi said on Twitter: “Advancing friendship with Australia. PM @ScottMorrisonMP held talks with PM @narendramodi. They discussed a wide range of subjects aimed at deepening economic and people-to-people linkages between India and Australia.\n\nMinistry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi termed the meeting as “another chapter in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Australia”.\n\n“Another chapter in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Australia! PM @narendramodi and @ScottMorrisonMP met today. Discussed regional & global developments as well as ongoing bilateral cooperation in areas related to COVID-19, trade, defence, clean energy & more,” Mr. Bagchi said on Twitter.\n\nThe meeting assumes significance as External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on September 11 held the 'two-plus-two' talks in New Delhi with their Australian counterparts Marise Payne and Peter Dutton.\n\nIt was the first meeting between the prime ministers of India and Australia since the AUKUS (Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.) security partnership was unveiled last week by U.S. President Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr. Morrison.\n\nIn response to a question, Mr. Shringla said that Prime Minister Morrison did briefly mention rationale from the Australian side in seeking to initiate the AUKUS Alliance.\n\n“He felt that the technology that they received was appropriate and there was a brief discussion in that regard,” he said.\n\nIn a tweet, the prime minister's office described it as advancing friendship with Australia. “They discussed a wide range of subjects aimed at deepening economic and people-to-people linkages between India and Australia,” the PMO tweeted.\n\nThe AUKUS partnership, seen as an effort to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, will allow the U.S. and the U.K. to provide Australia with the technology to develop nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.\n\nAustralia said its decision to join a security alliance with the U.S. and the U.K. is aimed at developing capabilities that can contribute along with India and other countries in deterring behaviour that threatens the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nIn the first reaction from India on the contentious alliance, Mr. Shringla on September 21 said that the new security agreement among the U.S., the U.K. and Australia is neither relevant to the Quad nor will have any impact on its functioning, and they are not groupings of a similar nature.\n\nMr. Shringla said while the AUKUS is a security alliance among the three countries, the Quad is a plurilateral grouping with a vision for a free, open, transparent and inclusive Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe Quad comprises India, the U.S., Japan and Australia.\n\nU.S. President Biden is hosting the first in-person Quad summit at the White House on September 24 to be attended by Mr. Modi, Mr. Morrison and Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.\n\nDevelopments in Afghanistan, the COVID-19 pandemic and ways to expand cooperation for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific are set to be the central focus of the four-nation grouping Quad.\n\nFrance reacted angrily to the formation of the new AUKUS alliance as it resulted in Paris effectively losing a multi-billion dollar deal to build 12 conventional submarines for Australia. France is also upset over its exclusion from the alliance.\n\nChina has also slammed the formation of the AUKUS.",

File Photo.\n\n19 February 2021 16:45 IST\n\nThe Foreign Secretary’s said in an interview with the Russian daily Kommersant during which he was asked whether India would bow to the U.S. pressure and give up the S-400 air defence missile systems deal with Russia.\n\nIndia’s strategic ties with Russia has very deep historic roots which provide stability and trust strong enough to navigate the complexities of the current world, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said, as he sought to allay concerns that New Delhi is under pressure from the U.S. to abandon military-technical cooperation with Moscow.\n\nMr. Shringla’s remarks came during an interview with the Russian daily Kommersant during which he was asked whether India would bow to the U.S. pressure and give up the S-400 air defence missile systems deal with Russia.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the previous Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite U.S. sanctions.\n\nResponding to a question, Mr. Shringla said, India’s relations with the U.S. and Russia stand on their own merits and all the major powers recognise fully India’s tradition of an independent foreign policy.\n\n“Our Strategic Partnership with Russia has very deep historic roots which provide stability, trust and confidence strong enough to navigate the complexities of the current world. We have a global strategic partnership with the United States,” he said.\n\n“I do not want to comment on the specific defence contracts, but let me state clearly that all the contracts concluded with Russia are being implemented according to schedule. These are consistent with India’s defence and security needs and interests,” he said.\n\nThe S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.\n\nWhen asked about the cancellation of the India-Russia Annual Summit in 2020 amid speculation of growing uneasiness between the two countries over certain sensitive diplomatic and security issues, like India’s ties with the U.S., Mr. Shringla said: “The only reason for not holding the Annual Summit last year was the Covid pandemic.” “However, we did have very high-level interactions, including a visit by our External Affairs Minister and two visits by Defence Minister to Moscow, one of which was for the 75th Anniversary of the Victory Day,” he said.\n\nMr. Shringla said the annual summit is a unique feature of the India-Russia relations since 2000.\n\nHe said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir have met 19 times since 2014 during bilateral summits and on the sidelines of multilateral fora.\n\n“They spoke with each other four times last year and enjoy a unique personal rapport,” he said.\n\n“India and Russia have worked together to overcome the difficulties of the Covid pandemic and I am sure bilateral relations will emerge even stronger as a result of our planned meetings this year,” he said.\n\nWhen asked about Russia’s unease with Quad — a group of U.S., Japan, Australia and India, Mr. Shringla said India sees “this concept as a framework for engagement with Russia.” Russia is an important Pacific power. During his speech in Vladivostok in Russia in September 2019, Prime Minister Modi referred to Vladivostok as a junction between Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific, Mr. Shringla said.\n\n“The Chennai-Vladivostok Maritime Corridor which will further link to the Northern Sea Route and the Pacific will create a connectivity continuum that will bind India and Russia together from the Arctic to the Indian Ocean,” he said.\n\n“Therefore, contrary to certain speculation, we feel that in reality, India and Russia have more in common on the concept of Indo-Pacific. A multi-polar world and multi-polar Asia has to recognise the indispensable role of India and Russia,” he added.\n\nMr. Shringla said India does not see the Indo-Pacific Region as a club of limited members nor as a new theatre for geostrategic contestation.\n\n“It includes all nations in this geography as also others beyond who have a stake in it aimed at Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR),” he said.\n\n“India’s approach focuses on a free, open, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific. We emphasise respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations in the region, peaceful resolution of disputes, avoidance of use or threat of use of force, and adherence to international laws, rules and regulations.\n\n“With respect to Quad, as vibrant and pluralistic democracies with shared values, India, U.S., Japan and Australia have collectively affirmed the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific,” he said.\n\n“They are aimed at advancing the security and the economic interests of all countries having legitimate and vital interests in the region,” Mr. Shringla said, amidst China flexing its muscles in the region.\n\nWhen asked about the challenges to India’s security stemming from troubled Afghan settlement, Mr. Shringla said: Afghanistan is passing through a critical phase.” The peace process in Afghanistan began last September in Doha. India participated at the level of External Affairs Minister in the inaugural session of the Intra-Afghan Negotiations.\n\n“We are of the view that any peace initiative which can bring peace and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan must be welcomed. India, as an important stakeholder, has been playing its role,” he said.\n\nHe, however, said India is equally concerned about the rise in violence as well as targeted attacks on civil society activists and media persons in Afghanistan.\n\n“Violence and talks cannot proceed simultaneously; it is not sustainable. There is a need to call for a comprehensive ceasefire in Afghanistan,” he said.\n\nIndia is actively following the developments in Afghanistan and remains engaged with other regional countries, and Russia, Mr. Shringla said. He said that Russia is an important ally as well as an important stakeholder in the region.\n\n“India, Russia and Iran recently had a trilateral meeting in Moscow on the Afghan situation,” he said.\n\n“All efforts must be made to preserve the gains Afghanistan has made in the past two decades. It is for this reason, we have always supported an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process,” Mr. Shringla said.\n\nIndia has committed over USD 3 billion as part of its development assistance to Afghanistan.\n\nOn Russia-India cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus, he said Russia was the first country to register a vaccine against COVID-19.\n\n“Of the 500 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine that Russia plans to produce in 2021, a significant portion is expected to be produced in India,” Mr. Shringla said.\n\nThe Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is in negotiations with several other Indian producers to manufacture higher doses of vaccines in India for use in Russia, India and other countries as well. The phase-3 trials of Sputnik V are ongoing in India and we expect regulatory approvals for emergency use authorization in India in due course, he said.\n\n“India-Russia cooperation in the fight against COVID-19 has reinforced the traditional bonds of friendship between our two countries. During the peak of Covid last spring, India supplied a consignment of Hydroxychloroquine tablets which was highly appreciated by the Russian leadership,” he added.\n\nHe expressed hope that India and Russia partnership will play a significant role in combating the pandemic.\n\n“In the post-pandemic world, we would see a redefining of our understanding in a number of areas, including our understanding of security, which until now, was thought largely in the military, intelligence and economic terms,” he said.\n\n“Today, greater weight is being assigned to health security and resilience of supply chains. Likewise, we will have to focus on the reform of multilateral institutions and recalibrate our approach to address global challenges such as climate change, terrorism, etc. In all these areas, India and Russia can work together for the common good,” he added.",

In an address at an online workshop on cooperation among India, Japan and France in the Indo-Pacific, he said New Delhi has not just mainstreamed the expression \"Indo-Pacific\", but also encouraged others to perceive and define the region in its full extent.\"Whatever the navigation map, it is an indisputable fact that the Indo-Pacific is the 21st century's locus of political and security concerns and competition, of growth and development, and of technology incubation and innovation,\" he said.Highlighting various aspects of India's Indo-Pacific strategy, Shringla referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for the region which he had enunciated as the SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) doctrine at Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore in 2018.\"This aspiration depends on securing end-to-end supply chains in the region; no disproportionate dependence on a single country; and ensuring prosperity for all stakeholder nations,\" Shiringla said at the workshop organised by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF).\"An Indo-Pacific guided by norms and governed by rules, with freedom of navigation, open connectivity, and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states, is an article of faith for India,\" he said.There has been growing global concerns among leading powers over China's increasing military assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region.The foreign secretary said India has sought to strengthen security and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific by becoming a net security provider - for instance in peacekeeping efforts or anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.He said India has built relationships with partner countries across the region in terms of equipment, training and exercises.\"To cite some examples, we are active in networks such as the Quad, with India, the US, Japan and Australia as participants, and the India-Japan-US, India-France-Australia and India-Indonesia-Australia trilateral arrangements offer cases in point,\" he said.Shringla said the Indo-Pacific has become an essential concept in international relations today, in theory as well as in practice, adding no foreign policy conversation is complete without a discussion on the region.\"Literally, it signifies the seamless interface of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. For India, it is that vast maritime space stretching from the western coast of North America to the eastern shores of Africa,\" he said.\"Over 50 per cent of global trade traverses this maritime domain. It is also home to over 60 per cent of the world's population and the global GDP. And so, the security, stability, peace and prosperity of this vast region is vital for the world,\" he added.The foreign secretary also elaborated on India's growing cooperation with both Japan and France.\"India, France and Japan are leading stakeholders in the region and with other like-minded countries, it is upon us to ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains peaceful and open, taking into account needs and concerns of all its inhabitants,\" he said.The foreign secretary also touched upon Prime Minister Modi's vision of \"a self-reliant India\".\"With both countries, as with the rest of the world, we are focusing on economic resilience and recovery. Our response to the current global uncertainty is reflected in the vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' articulated by Prime Minister Modi, which is a vision of 'a self-reliant India which is also a reliable friend for the world',\" he said.\"It envisages making India an integral part of global supply chains as well as promotion of international trade and commerce. One specific example of cooperation in this area is our working with Japan and Australian on a supply chains resilience initiative,\" Shringla said.",

We reaffirm that Afghan territory should not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts, and reiterate the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan,” according to the Joint Statement issued by the Quad leaders.“We denounce the use of terrorist proxies and emphasized the importance of denying any logistical, financial or military support to terrorist groups which could be used to launch or plan terror attacks, including cross-border attacks. We stand together in support of Afghan nationals, and call on the Taliban to provide safe passage to any person wishing to leave Afghanistan, and to ensure that the human rights of all Afghans, including women, children, and minorities are respected,” the joint statement affirmed in a clear message for Pakistani designs.\"Our four nations met for the first time after the 2004 Tsunami to help the Indo-Pacific region. Today, when the world is fighting against COVID-19 pandemic, we have come here once again as Quad for the welfare of humanity,\" PM Narendra Modi said in his initial remarks. \"Our Quad vaccine initiative will greatly help the Indo-Pacific countries,\" he said.The Prime Minister added he was \"confident that our participation in Quad will establish peace and prosperity in the world.\" Quad leaders at their first in-person summit shared perspectives on the situation in Afghanistan and the challenges in Indo-Pacific , Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said following the Summit.Speaking at a special briefing after the Quad leaders' meeting in Washington, Shringla said that the leaders also discussed a common approach to emerging technologies, cybersecurity and addressing the challenge of climate change.They shared perspectives on the situation in Afghanistan, the emerging challenges in South Asia and Indo-Pacific and reaffirmed their commitment to work together to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and work towards preventing the other pandemics that would come in the future. Evolving a common approach to emerging technologies, cybersecurity and addressing the challenge of climate change was something that the leaders discussed,\" Shringla said.Shringla said that Pakistan has really been in many senses instigator of some of the problems India is dealing with in our neighbourhood and beyond.\"Both in bilateral discussions and in Quad summit, there was a clear sense that more careful look, examination and monitoring Pakistan's role in Afghanistan, Pakistan's role on the issue of terrorism had to be kept and certainly whether it is Quad or other partners had to keep track to that factor, an important factor that sometimes gets overlooked when you see Pakistan projecting itself as a facilitator whether it has really been in many sense instigator of some of the problems we are dealing with in our neighbourhood and beyond,\" he said.India and the United States have expressed concern over Islamabad's role in Afghanistan, said Shringla adding that the two sides underscored the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan.\"I think there was clear concern in that regard on Pakistan's role in Afghanistan and their continuing for a certain approach that did not seem to be conducive to the international community expectations of what Afghanistan should be like,\" he said.Stability in the Indo-Pacific region also figured prominently at the Summit as evident from the joint statement. “We also recognize that our shared futures will be written in the Indo-Pacific, and we will redouble our efforts to ensure that the Quad is a force for regional peace, stability, security, and prosperity. Towards that end, we will continue to champion adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to meet challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the East and South China Seas.”The joint statement issued following the Summit held in the White House emphasised, “We stand for the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, democratic values, and territorial integrity of states.”The Quad also backed ASEAN centrality and EU Indo-Pacific strategy. “We reaffirm our strong support for ASEAN’s unity and centrality and for ASEAN’s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and we underscore our dedication towards working with ASEAN and its member states—the heart of the Indo-Pacific region—in practical and inclusive ways. We also welcome the September 2021 EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.”Vaccine manufacturing and distribution also figured prominently at the Summit. “Thanks to the Quad Vaccine Partnership’s financing of increased manufacturing capacity at Biological E LTD, additional production in India will come on line later this year. In line with our March announcement, and recognizing the continuing global supply gap, we will ensure this expanded manufacturing is exported for the Indo-Pacific and the world, and we will coordinate with key multilateral initiatives, such as the COVAX Facility, to procure proven safe, effective and quality-assured COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. We also recognize the importance of open and secure supply chains for vaccine production,” according to the joint statement.The Quad leaders welcome Biological E LTD’s production, including through our Quad investments, of at least one billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022. Today, we are proud to announce an initial step towards that supply that will immediately help the Indo-Pacific and the world to end the pandemic.Japan will continue to help regional partners purchase vaccines through $3.3 billion of COVID-19 Crisis Response Emergency Support Loan. Australia will deliver $212 million in grant aid to purchase vaccines for Southeast Asia and the Pacific. In addition, Australia will allocate $219 million to support last-mile vaccine rollouts and lead in coordinating the Quad’s last-mile delivery efforts in those regions.The Quad launched key initiatives across diverse sectors. “We are also launching today Quad Principles on Technology Design, Development, Governance, and Use that we hope will guide not only the region but the world towards responsible, open, high-standards innovation,” the joint statement announced.“Today, we begin new cooperation in cyber space and pledge to work together to combat cyber threats, promote resilience, and secure our critical infrastructure. In space we will identify new collaboration opportunities and share satellite data for peaceful purposes such as monitoring climate change, disaster response and preparedness, sustainable uses of oceans and marine resources, and on responding to challenges in shared domains. We will also consult on rules, norms, guidelines and principles for ensuring the sustainable use of outer space.”“We are proud to begin a new chapter of educational and people-to-people cooperation as we inaugurate the Quad Fellowship. Stewarded by Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative, and with generous support from Accenture, Blackstone, Boeing, Google, Mastercard, and Western Digital this pilot fellowship program will provide 100 graduate fellowships to leading science, technology, engineering, and mathematics graduate students across our four countries. Through the Quad Fellowship, our next generation of STEM talent will be prepared to lead the Quad and other like-minded partners towards the innovations that will shape our shared future,” the leaders noted.In his opening remarks, US President Joe Biden said the four democracies - the US, India, Australia and Japan - have come together to take on common challenges from Covid to climate. \"We know how to get things done and are up to the challenge,\" he said.The Australian Prime Minister said the Indo-Pacific region should be free from coercion and disputes should be solved in accordance with international law. \"The Indo-Pacific has great challenges and challenges have to be overcome. In six months from the last meeting so much has been accomplished. We stand here together in the Info Pacific region,\" he said.",

Focusing on contemporary issues such as vaccine, climate change and emerging technology ... the four leaders are expected to meet in person later this year on the sidelines of a big multilateral summit,\" foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters after the Summit, attended virtually by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , US President Joe Biden , and PMs Scott Morrison of Australian and Yoshihide Suga of Japan.The vaccine initiative will allow new manufacturing capacity to be added in India for exports to the Indo-Pacific region. \"It will not impinge on India's commitment for domestic consumption,\" Shringla said. \"We have an ambitious target to produce 1 billion vaccines by 2022,\" the foreign secretary said.India is a reliable partner in the global supply chain and received appreciation from the other leaders of the bloc of the democratic nations for providing vaccines to 70 countries under the Vaccine Maitri initiative, the foreign secretary told ET.The countries have decided to pool their resources and proactive efforts are ongoing to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 in the Indo-Pacific, he said.Three working groups have been formed among the Quad member nations on vaccine implementation, critical technology and climate. Stating that India looks forward to being a part of the three working groups, the foreign secretary said: \"These are articles of faith for India.\"This pooling of individual capacities and strengths by the Quad countries is aimed at expediting global vaccine delivery. It will help meet the demand-supply gap, focusing on the Indo-Pacific region. It will add momentum to ongoing efforts to contain the pandemic, pointed out people in the know of the plans.India's role in the Quad Vaccine Initiative will project and reinforce its credentials as a trusted, reliable manufacturer and supplier of quality vaccines. It will strengthen India's standing as the \"pharmacy of the world\", as a critical node in global health supply chains, he said.Shringla said the Quad grouping has India's whole-hearted and unstinting support.A joint statement released after the Summit called for building on the progress of countries achieved on health security and decided to join forces \"to expand safe, affordable, and effective vaccine production and equitable access, to speed economic recovery and benefit global health\".\"...We will, therefore, collaborate to strengthen equitable vaccine access for the Indo-Pacific, with close coordination with multilateral organisations including the World Health Organization and COVAX ... We will combine our nations' medical, scientific, financing, manufacturing and delivery, and development capabilities and establish a vaccine expert working group to implement our path-breaking commitment to safe and effective vaccine distribution,\" according to the joint statement.\"We will launch a critical- and emerging-technology working group to facilitate cooperation on international standards and innovative technologies of the future; and we will establish a climate working group to strengthen climate actions globally on mitigation, adaptation, resilience, technology, capacity-building, and climate finance,\" it said.",

We would like him to return to India as soon as possible,” said Mr. Shringla.\n\n“Also, Nirav Modi. I raised this with both Lord Ahmad and the Home Secretary, and both took very careful note of our priority and sentiments in that regard,” he said.\n\nMr. Mallya, wanted in India over fraud and money laundering charges in relation to loans taken out by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from state-owned Indian banks, has been found to have a case to answer in India by the U.K. courts. He is currently on bail, undergoing a “confidential” legal issue before Mr. Patel can consider signing off on his extradition order.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Modi, the fugitive diamond merchant accused of fraud and money laundering in relation to the state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB), is currently lodged in Wandsworth Prison in London as he fights his extradition to India at Westminster Magistrates’ Court.\n\nMr. Shringla arrived in London following visits to Paris and Berlin on Tuesday and has held a series of meetings to cover a wide range of issues, including the India-UK vaccine partnership in a post-coronavirus world and climate change as well as highlighting India’s outlook on the growing importance of the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nOn India-UK bilateral ties, the Foreign Secretary noted the backdrop of Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU) paving the way for a reset in the relationship — both with the U.K. and the EU.\n\n“We are looking at early harvest deals, which would bring benefits to both our countries, followed by a more detailed, either preferential trade agreement or a free trade agreement,” said Mr. Shringla.\n\n“Obviously, a limited deal means we work on those areas on which both sides can immediately agree to. We need more time to conclude a more comprehensive trade agreement but our ministers are in touch and will work on trying to close such a deal, he said.\n\n“We are also looking at a similar deal at the EU level, but bilateral agreement is always different from an agreement with a group, he added.\n\nThe Indian High Commissioner to the U.K., Gaitri Issar Kumar, highlighted the five priority areas of food and drink, life sciences, information and communications technology (ICT), chemicals and services that have been narrowed down by both sides, with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and U.K. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss set to take stock of the level of movement in these areas during talks scheduled for November 9.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Prime Minister Boris Johnson are among the high-level visits from the U.K. to India scheduled for 2021, depending on the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown situation.\n\nForeign Secretary Mr. Shringla noted that with the U.K. currently undertaking an Integrated Review of its policy framework, the Indo-Pacific region is expected to play a key part in the transformational relationship that Mr. Raab has previously made reference to vis-a-vis India.\n\n“We believe in the vision of free, open, transparent and inclusive Indo-Pacific stakeholders; we believe in multi-polarity. The framework is there in France and Germany and we see it in the UK also, though it is yet to be articulated in policy framework. It (the Indo-Pacific) has become more significant, relevant and topical,” said Mr. Shringla.\n\nBesides his Ministerial-level and official talks, the foreign secretary also conducted a host of discussions with leading business chiefs and CEOs.",

India stands with France in the fight against terrorism,” Mr. Modi tweeted.\n\nAhead of the visit, the External Affairs Ministry of had condemned a similar beheading of a school teacher in a Parisian suburb last week, and backed French President Emmanuelle Macron against “personal attacks in unacceptable language” made by Turkey and Pakistan.\n\n“We believe there is no justification for terrorism,” said External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday, when asked about the latest attack.\n\nDuring his visit, Mr. Shringla, who is due to travel to Germany and the United Kingdom next as part of the week-long three-nation tour, is also expected to focus on strategic partnership, cooperating on the Indo-Pacific, and dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“The in-person consultations with European interlocutors are another step in India’s pandemic-age diplomacy,” Mr. Shringla tweeted.\n\nThe MEA said several aspects of dealing with COVID-19, including cooperation in the development of a vaccine, diagnostics and testing, procuring medical equipment and ensuring safe treatment, as well as dealing with the post-Covid impact on the economy are on the agenda for talks.\n\nBoosting supply\n\nIn particular, the MEA spokesperson said talks would include “enhancing supply chain resilience”, indicating that concerns over an over-dependence on Chinese manufacturing over the past few months, which has been shared in Europe, would also come up.\n\n“This is part of our continuing outreach despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We share democratic values with them, they are our strategic partners. We have multidimensional relations with them,” Mr. Srivastava said, referring to the three-nation visit, adding that the Foreign Secretary would discuss India’s “commitment to a free open and inclusive Indo Pacific”, as well.\n\nMr. Shringla’s travels follow the Indo-U.S. 2+2 consultations in Delhi this week, where U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also highlighted the need for countries to cooperate on the Indo-Pacific where he said the Chinese ruling party “CCP is no friend to democracy, the rule of law, transparency, the freedom of navigation [which is] the foundation of a free and prosperous Indo-Pacific.”\n\nThe visit by Mr. Shringla is a push for “proactive diplomacy” by the MEA, after months of virtual meetings. Mr. Shringla, who is expected to travel to the neighbourhood including the Maldives in November, has travelled only to Bangladesh and Myanmar during the past few months. During his stops in Paris, Berlin and London, the Foreign Secretary is expected to interact with business chambers, academics and media.\n\n“This was an Indian initiative, and we are delighted to host the Indian Foreign Secretary at a time when it is complicated for us to meet in other situations,” a European diplomat said, referring to the fact that many other high level meetings and summits are still being held in the virtual format due to the pandemic.",

We think that it is dangerous and not in anybody’s security interest,” Ms. Sherman said in response to a question from The Hindu at a roundtable with journalists on Wednesday.\n\n“That said, we have a strong partnership with India; we want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead and discussions between our countries try to solve problems,” she added, hoping that the talks in the weeks ahead would resolve this issue as well.\n\nAccording to sources, Ms. Sherman, who met with NSA Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday, also “raised” the S-400 purchase during her talks over lunch with Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla.\n\nHer comments followed a day after Indian Airforce (IAF) Chief Air Chief Marshal (ACM) V.R. Chaudhari confirmed that the $5.43 billion S-400 system deal signed in 2018 with Russia is “on track” and the “first regiment” is expected to be inducted “within this year”, or by end-December 2021.\n\nThe delivery is expected to trigger sanctions under the U.S.’s CAATSA law, which Washington has already imposed on Turkey and China for buying the S-400, unless the U.S. President steps in with a waiver. Government sources said the issue will continue to be discussed by the two sides.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the two sides are expected to meet for a number of bilateral functions, including the Defence Policy Dialogue headed by Defence Secretaries in Washington this weekend, the Joint Working Group (JWG) on Counter Terrorism on October 26th, leading up to the “2+2” meeting of Defence and Foreign Ministers together in November.\n\nA delegation from the office of the U.S. Trade Representative is in Delhi for trade talks this week, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to travel to Washington “soon”, said government sources, possibly next week, to attend the International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meeting, and for the Economic and Financial Partnership meeting with her counterpart U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nDescribing the partnership during a public address to the U.S. India Business Council (USIBC)’s India Ideas Summit shortly after the meeting, Mr. Shringla indicated that the future of the Indo-Pacific region, and the situation in Afghanistan were at the top of their discussions.\n\n“Given the fast-paced developments in South Asia, especially in Afghanistan, India and the U.S. will remain closely engaged both on the future of Afghanistan, and on how we can maintain peace and stability in South Asia, and beyond,” Mr. Shringla said.\n\nWhen asked if the U.S. is discussing the possibility of cooperating on sourcing military bases with India, or with countries like Uzbekistan and Pakistan, which are part of Ms. Sherman’s current tour, she said the U.S. is discussing its options for airstrikes on Afghanistan through “over the horizon” (OTH) efforts, but did not elaborate further on India’s response.\n\n“All of our departments and agencies have put together a very robust programme of what we call “over the horizon efforts” of partnership on counterterrorism with India as part of that strong process to make sure that India’s security is first and foremost, in our minds, we will always have Indian security front and centre in our considerations of how the United States proceeds,” Ms. Sherman said.\n\nMs. Sherman and Mr. Shringla also spoke “at length” about the Quad vaccine partnership which will entail manufacturing one billion J&J American vaccines in India by end 2022, said sources, but denied that the issue of indemnity clauses, which India insists on, will be a roadblock to the Quad proposals. Ms. Sherman said she had “applauded” India’s decision to resume its vaccine exports that were cancelled during the pandemic’s second wave in April, and both sides discussed future cooperation on vaccines.\n\nM. Sherman will travel to Mumbai on Thursday for meetings with business persons, and will head to Pakistan after that.",

                        "docText": "The FBI has been hacking into the computers of US companies running insecure versions of Microsoft software in order to fix them, the US Department of Justice has announced.\n\nThe operation, approved by a federal court, involved the FBI hacking into “hundreds” of vulnerable computers to remove malware placed there by an earlier malicious hacking campaign, which Microsoft blamed on a Chinese hacking group known as Hafnium.\n\nHafnium’s operation placed backdoors into “tens of thousands” of servers running Microsoft’s Exchange software, which allows businesses to manage emails, contacts and calendars for their employees. It took advantage of a weakness in the servers, now fixed, to plant the malware, which allowed the hackers to return at a later date.\n\nThe FBI’s campaign uses the same weakness in the “hundreds” of servers that have still not been patched to hack the hackers – breaking into the vulnerable computers and removing the backdoors entirely.\n\n“Today’s court-authorised removal of the malicious web shells demonstrates the Department’s commitment to disrupt hacking activity using all of our legal tools, not just prosecutions,” the US Department of Justice’s assistant attorney general, John C Demers, said.\n\n“Combined with the private sector’s and other government agencies’ efforts to date, including the release of detection tools and patches, we are together showing the strength that public-private partnership brings to our country’s cybersecurity.”\n\nAlthough the FBI’s campaign removed the malware placed by one hacker group, it did not actively fix the underlying vulnerability, meaning that affected computers may simply be reinfected in the future if their owners do not take action to protect them.\n\nThe FBI says it is “attempting” to notify all the owners of the affected computers, either by sending them an email from an official FBI email account, or emailing their internet service providers.\n\nBenevolent hacking, also called a “white hat” hack, is rare, particularly from state actors, but not unheard-of. In 2016, a widespread weakness in internet-of-things devices led to the creation of a botnet called Mirai, which allowed criminals to seize millions of devices and direct them at websites and services, overwhelming them with traffic and crashing them.\n\nBut in 2017, a computer virus called Hajime was discovered to be infecting devices through the same weakness, and closing the door behind it. A message from the virus’s author said they were “just a white hat, securing some systems”.",

Forget Kim Kardashian.\n\nIn the good old days, hackers could launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack - overloading computer servers with millions of pointless requests for information, thereby knocking them out - using personal computers infected with malware.\n\nNowadays, they also have the IoT to play with - the increasingly diverse array of web-connected devices, from industrial sensors to clever fridges, thermostats to baby monitors.\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption Gartner forecasts there will be 21 billion connected devices globally by 2020\n\nResearch consultancy Gartner forecasts that there will be nearly 21 billion connected things in use worldwide by 2020, up from about seven billion now.\n\nSo the hackers are moving away from better-policed corporations and governments to easier targets - and they don't come easier than the IoT-connected smart home.\n\nSo what should we be doing to protect ourselves?\n\nBuilding defences\n\nOne quick and easy thing we can all do is change default passwords as soon as we buy an IoT gadget.\n\n\"The first rule of security is 'do not use default accounts or passwords'. They are posted on the internet, so the bad guys don't have to scan for credentials of assets to compromise,\" says Gary Hayslip, IoT specialist and chief information security officer for the City of San Diego.\n\nSimple tools such as Bullguard's IoT Scanner software can also help spot weaknesses.\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption Who might really be controlling your connected home devices?\n\nThe scanner detects any devices on a smart home network that are publicly exposed using the vulnerability service Shodan, the Google for finding unprotected computers and webcams.\n\nIf the scan identifies any exposed devices specified by the vendor, then you should immediately change log-ins and passwords. BullGuard has also published an IoT manual that gives a checklist on what to check and how.\n\nInterestingly, the company recently acquired Israeli start-up Dojo-labs and will soon announce a smart network security device that plugs in to a wi-fi router to protect all connected devices on a home network.\n\nImage copyright Dojo-labs Image caption The Dojo device plugs into the back of your wi-fi router to protect all your smart home devices\n\nAll internet traffic on the home network is routed via Dojo, allowing it to secure the network against cyber-attacks and protect the user from privacy breaches.\n\nWhen malicious activity or a privacy breach is detected, Dojo automatically blocks it and notifies the owner through a mobile app, the company says.\n\n\"The recent internet outage caused by the Mirai botnet enhances the fact that IoT security needs to be taken more seriously,\" says Bullguard chief executive Paul Lipman.\n\n\"The Mirai botnet consists of easily hackable low-end security cameras with no changeable passwords. A home security device such as Dojo has the ability to instantly detect and block an attack such as Mirai.\"\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption Security cameras have been particularly vulnerable to hacking in recent years\n\nAnd Martin Talks, founder of digital consultancy Matomico, offers this advice for smart home owners.\n\n\"Only point connected cameras where they are really needed. It was Edward Snowden who alerted us to the fact that cameras can be taken over and our presence in our houses monitored. If you don't need a camera active, tape over it.\n\n\"Think about what devices you really need to connect to the internet,\" he adds. \"And if you decide you do need to connect a device, use the connectivity only when you need it... turn it off at night.\"\n\nOther ways to increase IoT security including keeping product software and firmware up-to-date and buying from trusted brands and trusted platforms.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption EXPLAINED: What is a DDoS attack?\n\nOne of the reasons why some electronics are cheaper than others is that manufacturers cut corners on security - like putting cheap tyres on an expensive car.\n\nDivided we fall?\n\nSo what is the IoT industry doing to improve security? After all, it's their products that are turning our connected homes into new recruits for botnet armies.\n\nWhile most agree that common security standards are a good idea, the unhelpful response has been to set up a number of competing associations each developing their own standards: the Online Trust Alliance, the IoT Security Foundation, the Open Connectivity Foundation, and the Industrial Internet Consortium, for example.\n\nMeanwhile the big tech companies - Apple, Amazon, LG and Samsung primarily - still believe they can create their own closed ecosystems and dominate the smart home market using their own standards.\n\nAdd to this product makers who do things on the cheap and lazy consumers sticking with default passwords, and you have all the conditions for the perfect IoT security storm.\n\nSo until the industry gets its act together, it's up to us to prevent our homes becoming weapons of web destruction.\n\nFollow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter\n\nClick here for more Technology of Business features",

Acclaimed by World Economic Forum, Gartner.\n\ngetty\n\nComputers are faster, smaller and more affordable than ever before. More interestingly, they are being integrated into many consumer products, making everything from our beds to wristwatches smarter, Internet of Things-ready and capable of doing automated tasks. These “smart” devices are proliferating faster than you might expect, with smartwatches becoming one of the largest groups of connected devices, according to data from my company.\n\nHowever, I’ve seen firsthand through my company’s AI cybersecurity platform that many IoT devices are not sufficiently protected against cyberattacks. Some devices lack even the most basic security measures. As a result, IoT-based cyberattacks are becoming more frequent. For example, variations of the Mirai botnet have infected countless consumer IoT devices since 2016.\n\nThis is disturbing, knowing that IoT devices are becoming more and more popular. This makes a large part of the domestic population at risk of having their home network security compromised if steps are not taken to secure their IoT devices.\n\nVulnerable connected devices are also a threat to businesses, especially considering bring-your-own-device campaigns and hybrid work arrangements where employees use their own devices to access corporate networks.\n\nToday, dozens of IoT device categories are vying for their place under the sun, and while some devices that have a history of security issues might not be gaining a lot of popularity, I’ve seen wearables emerge as one of the most popular IoT devices and believe they could become a target for malicious actors.\n\nOverall cybersecurity depends on IoT security.\n\nThe Mirai botnet attack had a significant impact on internet usability back in 2016 and showed why vulnerable IoT devices can be a threat to key infrastructure. It should have been a wakeup call for IoT manufacturers and the wider public. Unfortunately, I’ve found that some manufacturers continue making devices with severe security issues, such as open ports or hard-coded root passwords.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are also a threat to consumer home networks, as compromised IoT devices have been shown to provide access to other devices on local networks. Such IoT attacks can result in the loss of valuable data from network data storage devices and could also lead to the penetration of corporate environments down the line.\n\nIoT device manufacturers can work to avoid a few key security issues.\n\nFrom my perspective, the largest issue in IoT security is that many consumer IoT devices are manufactured without some basic security considerations. There are too few incentives and not enough pressure from consumers to create devices that are secure by design.\n\nJust some of the security challenges IoT device manufactures can work to reduce are:\n\n• Easy-to-guess, default, weak or hard-coded passwords.\n\n• Lack of secure update mechanisms.\n\n• Abandoned devices that are unsupported halfway through their expected lifetime.\n\n• Unpatched operating software.\n\n• Insecure data storage and transfer.\n\n• No multi-factor authentication for cloud services.\n\n• Open ports.\n\nEvery day, new IoT devices appear on the market with these and other vulnerabilities. While some might claim there are no common standards for IoT security, the things mentioned above are extremely basic security flaws that have no place in online-capable devices of the 21st century. Some manufacturers have started to rely on cloud solutions to avoid most of these security issues, but I believe last year’s Google outage showed that cloud solutions might not be the only solution in terms of IoT reliability.\n\nThere are a few security issues consumers and organizations should be aware of as well.\n\nEveryone should have some knowledge of the threats and issues that come with IoT devices. The following are some potential security issues consumers and organizations should be aware of.\n\n1. Participation in botnet attacks: Armies of remotely controlled devices (bots) can stay dormant for a long time unless you examine your device traffic, which does need some technical knowledge. When compromised devices are not quarantined, large groups of them can launch a botnet attack and send massive amounts of traffic to take down a target. These attacks can be large and focused on critical infrastructure, or they can be small-scale attacks on individuals.\n\nMalicious actors might also use more sophisticated techniques, such as mirrored attacks, where a compromised device can send a single request to notify the botnet of its presence and would then be targeted by the whole botnet. Based on my experience in cybersecurity, these sorts of attacks are likely to become more common as industrial IoT expands with 5G deployments.\n\n2. Ransomware in IoT: Ransomware is quickly becoming an extremely popular and lucrative form of malware. It is constantly evolving and is already used to target IoT devices. About 65% of the surveillance cameras in Washington, D.C., were affected by ransomware in 2017, for example, which left the police with no capability to record for two days, according to the Washington Post. In addition, health care gadgets, wearables, smart devices, smart homes and ecosystems have also become prone to risk and attacks.\n\n3. Lack of user awareness and knowledge: Some device manufacturers are improving their device support and updates and even patching devices that have reached the end of life. I recommend basing purchase decisions on these factors. I also recommend always changing the default login credentials of all devices and using complex passwords, as well as taking advantage of advanced cybersecurity solutions that protect your whole network, including potentially vulnerable IoT devices.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAttacks on consumer IoT devices do not need to be very sophisticated, but they can still do a lot of damage to someone’s home and business. The only way to deal with these issues is to have a combination of better manufacturing practices and consumer awareness. As the growth of the IoT device market continues, the security issues coming from this space cannot be ignored by brands or consumers any longer.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

He said he was not aware of the group using Emotet for distribution.\n\nThe Emotet and NetWalker operations build on one by Microsoft late last year against a different botnet known as Trickbot — which was pushed out using Emotet and used in ransomware attacks. The U.S. National Security Agency was also reported to have tried to take down Trickbot.\n\nMicrosoft last year derailed a different botnet known as Trickbot, which was pushed out using Emotet. (Michel Spingler/The Associated Press)\n\nCostin Raiu, research director at the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, said the Emotet takedown \"should impact other cybercriminal groups' ability to maintain and grow their botnets.

                        "docText": "GM of Primekey, a Swedish EJBCA PKI company with offices in Stockholm, San Mateo, Aachen and Melbourne.\n\ngetty\n\nWinston Churchill famously said that “those that fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it.” Ransomware has captured the attention of hackers and security professionals alike, with major attacks against critical infrastructure sectors resulting in major payouts to these criminal groups.\n\nCybersecurity has often been compared to a game of cat and mouse. As security professionals “move the cheese” to make ransomware less successful and profitable, malicious actors must change their tactics. However, this sort of protection is predicated on organizations responding after bad actors have already attacked. How can organizations better prepare for the future? Churchill would say they must learn from the past.\n\nLearning From The Pastrior to the recent outbreak of ransomware, the Mirai botnet was one of the most high-profile attacks in the past decade. Mirai leveraged compromised IoT devices to launch the largest DDoS attacks in history. These devices were compromised because they had poor security.\n\nThe Mirai botnet may seem like recent history, but a lot can change in five years. Case in point, it’s estimated that there will be more than 75 billion IoT-connected devices by 2025 — a nearly 300% increase since 2019. In addition to the exponential growth of IoT devices, many of these devices are completely wireless and devoid of any management interface — a so-called “headless device.”\n\nChallenges Of The PresentEach new IoT device is a new target for attack. It’s become a challenge to protect these devices at the same pace as their explosive growth. Here are a few real-world use cases that illustrate the rapid adoption of certain connected devices and the specific challenges they face:\n\n• Internet-connected cars: Today, it’s estimated that “one in five vehicles on the road worldwide will have some form of wireless network connection.” Security researchers have already demonstrated the real-world risk of hacking internet-connected vehicles — a risk that seems even more serious with the emergence of autonomous vehicles. It’s become critical that auto manufacturers can validate these internet-connected systems as they come off the manufacturing line to make sure they haven’t been altered, as well as establish secure data tunnels for over-the-air updates and data sharing. As the sales of electric vehicles surge, it’s imperative that security scales with it.\n\n• Wearable medical devices: The market for wearable and connected medical devices is booming and expected to continue at a 26.8% compound annual growth rate until 2028. Security researchers have also demonstrated the real-world risk of hacking connected medical devices. Consequently, medical device manufacturers should be equally concerned with validating their devices as they come off the manufacturing line. Additionally, a specific challenge for certain wearable medical devices is that they need to be replaced frequently (as often as every two weeks), which requires security to scale with this ebb and flow.\n\n• Retail and hospitality devices: The rise of connected devices at retail and hospitality establishments can be witnessed with a quick trip to the mall or at any number of hotels or restaurant chains you might visit during a family vacation. These include handheld devices that retail employees use to track inventory and facilitate sales transactions, or tablets that enable customers to access and purchase additional amenities. A particular challenge for the retail industry is scaling for seasonal shoppers and employees.\n\nSecuring The Future: Identity Is KeyHistorically, the legacy security model was focused on protecting users, their devices and their emails. However, the rise of cloud computing has resulted in the ongoing transition to zero trust security. Zero trust security requires its users to validate their identities before accessing corporate resources, such as through an identity and access management solution.\n\nHowever, IoT devices have blurred the lines between users and devices with the concept of a “machine identity.” Zero trust security also dictates that this machine identity must be authenticated. A user name and password are the most common approach to authentication, but this can be time-consuming and difficult to manage on IoT devices (especially headless devices). IoT device management solutions coupled with identity and access management (IAM) are another option. Public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions can also authenticate devices through the use of trusted certificates.\n\nAgile solutions become even more important on wireless and headless devices because they lack many native network protections. When a wireless device enters an untrusted environment, it still needs to remain protected and to operate as expected. However, over-the-air updates and authentication can become complex for organizations spread across the globe because of latency and connectivity issues. Cloud-based authentication solutions deliver the security benefits of traditional authentication processes with the management flexibility of a cloud service, making them ideal for wireless and headless IoT devices.\n\nIoT Security Is A Shared ResponsibilityThe threat landscape is constantly evolving, but the one thing that remains the same is that attackers will always look for the weakest link. And even though a lot can change in five years, just as much can stay the same, such as the inertia to protect these devices.\n\nAs organizations respond to the increase in ransomware, wireless IoT devices may soon emerge as the next target because they are more difficult to protect. If the attack on Colonial Pipeline has demonstrated the impact of ransomware on critical infrastructure, then imagine what could happen if ransomware compromised a connected car or medical device.\n\nUltimately, IoT security is a shared responsibility. Authentication can help. Manufacturers need certificates to validate their devices as they come off the line. Organizations need certificates to authenticate the machine identity of their IoT devices. And both manufacturers and organizations can benefit from the flexible security of cloud-based authentication, enabling them to stay a step ahead of the next attack.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

And we’re going to investigate it and figure out what this is all about.”\n\nSpokesperson Chloe Martin said the Anchorage FBI office is in regular contact with Anchorage police.\n\n“If, in the course of the local investigation, information comes to light of a potential federal civil rights violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate,” she said in an email to the AP.\n\nThim said to his knowledge, these were the first reports of such stickers showing up in Anchorage. But in Washington state last October, similar stickers were placed on several businesses in Bellingham, the Bellingham Herald reported at the time.\n\n“Swastikas have also become a symbol of white supremacy and the far right, and actions like this disproportionately impact people of color in the LGBTQ community,” said Laura Carpenter, executive director of Identity Inc., a statewide LGBTQ+ organization headquartered in Anchorage, not too far from Mad Myrna's.\n\n“This is just another example of people trying to demonize the LGBTQ community and Jewish people,” Carpenter said.\n\nUnder Adolf Hitler, Nazis systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II. Nazis also persecuted gays, mostly men. About 15,000 were sent to camps and at least half were killed.\n\nIn concentration camps, Jews wore yellow stars, gays wore pink stars and gay Jews wore an emblem combining the two colors. Other Nazi targets included communists, Slavs, gypsies and Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\n“Jewish people have 4,000 years’ experience of persecution,” Greenberg said.\n\nHe called the person on the scooter, a man believed to be in his late 20s or 30s, a coward whose only purpose was to create fear.\n\n“He is dealing with the wrong people,” Greenberg said. “We are not the people that fear.”\n\nHe said the FBI and police indicated it was not a serious or organized threat.\n\n“One guy got excited about something he read on the internet and came and put a sticker,” he said.\n\nPolice asking for the public’s help to find the person who did it and “to make a statement that the entire community us united, that such things cannot happen in this community,” Greenberg said.\n\nWith assistance from a local firm, security personnel will be on site at the museum and adjacent property for the foreseeable future.",

All contained malicious Word documents, either attached to the email itself or downloadable by clicking on a link.\n\nHowever, the real threat of Emotet weas the way that it was hired out to other cybercriminals for loader operations that allowed other types of malware, such as banking Trojans or ransomware, to be installed.\n\nOn average, Emotet was used to send out 100,000 malicious emails per day, using several hundred servers around the world; and as part of the investigation, a database containing email addresses, usernames and passwords has been discovered.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCA says that it's been able to trace some of the funds used to pay for the infrastructure. It says $10.5 million was moved over a two-year period on just one virtual currency platform, with almost $500,000 spent by the group over the same period to maintain its criminal infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the law enforcement bodies have yet to track down the individuals behind Emotet - bringing the risk that, if left at large, they will be able to resurrect it in some form.

Those who don't risk having data exfiltrated by the hackers exposed publicly.\n\nWilliams said via text message that although someone will eventually fill the gap \"there's no question that this will hurt [ransomware gangs] and help defenders in the short/mid term.\"\n\nAuthorities in the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, the U.K., France, Lithuania, Canada and Ukraine took part in the international operation coordinated by the two Hague-based agencies.\n\nDutch prosecutors said the malware, run out of eastern Europe by a Russian-speaking organization, was first discovered in 2014 and \"evolved into the go-to solution for cybercriminals over the years,\" responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses beginning with financial theft through a banking trojan.\n\nThey said two of the main servers for the infrastructure were based in the Netherlands and a third in another undisclosed country.\n\nThe Emotet botnet was effectively used to manage infections of victims and provide a distributed bulwark against takedown attempts by authorities.\n\nIn the disruption by law enforcement, its command-and-control infrastructure was routed to servers controlled by law enforcement, cutting off criminal tenants of Emotet from quarry they have infected.\n\nEuropol said law enforcement agencies' approach was \"unique and new.\"\n\nMan from Quebec arrested\n\nIn the FBI case, the agency announced in Washington, D.C., the attempt to disrupt against NetWalker, a relatively new ransomware gang accused of amassing tens of millions of dollars.\n\nRansomware expert Brett Callow at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft said its victims include Michigan State University, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District in Illinois, the College of Nurses of Ontario and the Medical School of the University of California at San Francisco, which paid a $1.1 million US ransom.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson said Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins of Gatineau, Quebec, was arrested in the scheme and the agency said in a statement that cryptocurrency worth $454,000 US in ransomware income was seized.\n\nAn indictment unsealed Wednesday said Vachon-Desjardins took part in a scheme to extort an unnamed Tampa, Fla., business.\n\nThe U.S. will be seeking Vachon-Desjardin's extradition, according to U.S. Justice Department spokesperson Joshua Stueve.\n\nTakedown should impact other criminal groups\n\nEarlier this week, authorities in Bulgaria took down a dark web site that NetWalker used to communicate with its victims, it said.\n\nCallow said it was too early to say how big of an impact the arrest would have on NetWalker, whose members are Russian speakers. He said he was not aware of the group using Emotet for distribution.\n\nThe Emotet and NetWalker operations build on one by Microsoft late last year against a different botnet known as Trickbot — which was pushed out using Emotet and used in ransomware attacks. The U.S. National Security Agency was also reported to have tried to take down Trickbot.\n\nMicrosoft last year derailed a different botnet known as Trickbot, which was pushed out using Emotet. (Michel Spingler/The Associated Press)\n\nCostin Raiu, research director at the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, said the Emotet takedown \"should impact other cybercriminal groups' ability to maintain and grow their botnets. It remains to be seen if they will be able to stage a comeback, be it either as Emotet, or perhaps merge with another group and continue from there.\"\n\nEmotet's \"door-opening\" malicious software was automatically delivered to computers in infected email attachments containing Word documents.\n\n\"A variety of different lures were used to trick unsuspecting users into opening these malicious attachments,\" Dutch prosecutors said in a statement. Emotet email campaigns have been disguised as invoices, shipping notices and COVID-19 information.\n\nCryptocurrency has been a great enabler of cybercrime and has led law enforcement to step up efforts to track online transactions of dirty money.\n\nIn 2017, police shut down the world's leading \"darknet\" marketplace — then Dutch police quietly seized a second bazaar to amass intelligence on illicit drug merchants and buyers.",

Since its return in mid-July, the malware has impacted 5% of organisations globally.\n\n(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nThe most wanted malware returned after a five-month hiatus in mid-July 2020. It marked its return by sending waves of spam campaigns affecting organisations globally.\n\nKnown as Emotet among the cyber security community, the malware group broke its period of inactivity in July with a massive threat campaign with well over 250,000 emails containing malicious macros.\n\nIn the same month, it impacted 5% of organisations globally and made to the top of Global Threat Index, according to Check Point Research, a cyber security firm.\n\nA malware is a software intentionally used to damage computer networks to steal data. The stolen information is often sold on the dark web or given back to the owner for a ransom. At other times, cybercriminals just put them out in the open.\n\nEmotet operators were spreading malspam campaigns both by themselves and at other times supporting other threat actors to steal banking credentials and gain illicit access into infected networks.\n\nThe group’s method is simple; it sends a malicious document named “form.doc” or “invoice.doc” via email to an unsuspecting user.\n\nOnce that person opens the attachment, the malware is deployed a PowerShell that runs codes from remote websites to spread the threat to the entire network the user is connected to.\n\nThe infected network will then be added to the Emotet’s botnet. That means the hacker takes full control over the network from a remote location.\n\n‘Malware as a Service’ model\n\nThis type of attack is called a ‘loader’ operation; and Emotet is said to be one of the biggest players in the cybercrime world as other malware operators like TrickBot and Qbot rent access from ‘most wanted’ malware.\n\nEmotet rents out infected networks to other threat actors like cryto-miners, banking trojans and ransomware installers to gain illicit access into company servers.\n\nThe malware is said to be operated from Russia, and its operator is nicknamed Ivan by cyber security researchers.\n\nAlso Read Interpol says cybercriminals are targeting large corporations, governments\n\nIts operations did not start out as Malware as a Service (MaaS) business model six years ago when it started to gain prominence in the cybercrime world.\n\nBack in 2014, Emotet surreptitiously entered user’s devices as a banking trojan, lurked inside and stole their credentials and passwords.\n\nIn just a few years, the malware has metamorphosed from a mere one-off hacker into an infrastructure provider for other threat actors to run campaigns and steal data.\n\nIts unique way of infecting networks by spreading the threat laterally after gaining access to just a few devices in the network makes it one of the toughest malwares to beat.\n\nEmotet’s self-propagating feature presents a particular challenge to organisations as the victims can get affected even without clicking the malicious links.\n\n“Once on a computer, Emotet downloads and executes a spreader module that contains a password list that it uses to attempt to brute force access to other machines on the same network,” Symantec security said in a blog post.\n\nCryptolaemus - the Mealybug hunter group\n\nDuring 2016 and the following year, Emotet, also know as the Mealybug, transformed from a being a small group of hackers who stole money from bank accounts to a malware loader that gave access to other threat groups.\n\nIt changed its codebase to infect victims and allow other malware operators rent the network.\n\nAnd as the number of threat campaigns using Emotet increased, a group of security researchers from different organisations decided to come together and share threat intelligence on the malware.\n\nAlso Read AI-based system can spot unauthorised cryptocurrency mining\n\nIn 2018, they formed a group called Cryptolaemus to share details about indicators of compromise (IoC) with the broader infosec community. The group posted updates on their web page and twitter handle. Their singular goal is to shut down the Mealybug.\n\nThe details shared by the group was used by other companies’ network administrators to detect any threat early on. Interestingly, the group’s notes were also followed by Emotet operators.\n\n\"We have seen them [Emotet] change tactics minutes after our posts, often enough that it is more than simple coincidence. I am quite sure they are part of the many reading our posts as soon as they go live,\" Joseph Roosen, a Cryptolaemus member and cyber security expert told ZDnet.\n\nRoosen also shared that the group has “even joked that they (Emotet) are now calling the three botnets as Epoch 1, Epoch 2, and Epoch 3 internally (based on the names we assigned them).\"\n\nThe team has had some initial success in helping companies battle Emotet.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the malware group did stop its campaign for some time, almost a year after the bug-hunting group started sharing information.\n\n“It’s interesting that Emotet was dormant for several months earlier this year, repeating a pattern we first observed in 2019,” said Maya Horowitz, Director, Threat Intelligence & Research, Products at Check Point.\n\nBut it turned out that Emotet was actually updating its features and capabilities to enhance future attacks. They were not planning to tap out yet.\n\nThe vulnerability and the vaccine\n\nEmotet attacks surged in late 2019 and went on until February 2020. Just when the pandemic was affecting many countries, the malware’s campaign slowed down to a halt.\n\nThe reason: someone from the Cryptolaemus group found a vulnerability in the malware.\n\n“Just as attackers can exploit flaws in legitimate software to cause harm, defenders can also reverse-engineer malware to discover its vulnerabilities and then exploit those to defeat the malware,” James Quinn, security analyst at Binary Defense said in blog post.\n\nQuinn discovered a bug in Emotet that could be exploited. He spotted a change in the malware’s persistence mechanism, a code the outlives computer reboots.\n\nIn early Feburary, Emotet had released a massive codebase overhaul that revealed changes it is installation and persistence mechanism.\n\nAs part of the change, the malware had removed word list and file generation algorithm, which were used in its past installs.\n\nInstead, Emotet replaced a new algorithm that generated a filename to save the malware on each victim system by randomly chosen exe or dll system file name.\n\nThis filename was encrypted with an exclusive key and saved into a registry value set to the victim’s volume serial number.\n\n“Around 37 hours after Emotet unveiled these changes, James Quinn finished the first version of the killswitch (or vaccine) that eventually became EmoCrash,” Binary Defense said in a blog post.\n\nThe killswitch would generate the registry key value for each victim and set the data for them to null.\n\nWhen Emotet would check Registry for the install marker, it would find the newly-generated null value and generate the exe name “.exe”, it added.\n\nWhile this mechanism worked, it was very messy and still allowed Emotet to install—it just prevented Emotet from running successfully and reaching out over the network.\n\nQuinn wanted to enhance the effectiveness of the killswitch so that it could pre-empt an Emotet attack.\n\nHis second version exploited a simple buffer overflow discovered in Emotet’s installation routine, which caused Emotet to crash during malware install, but before the malware would drop itself to the normal Emotet install locations, thus completely preventing malware installation.\n\nQuinn and the team of infosec researchers kept the killswitch private so that the malware actors would not know about the vaccine they found.\n\nThis killswitch was alive between Feb 6th, 2020 – Aug 6th, 2020, or 182 days - - a period of Emotet’s hiatus.",

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez\n\n(Reuters) - International law enforcement agencies said on Wednesday they had dismantled a criminal hacking scheme used to steal billions of dollars from businesses and private citizens worldwide.\n\nPolice in six European countries, as well as Canada and the United States, completed a joint operation to take control of Internet servers used to run and control a malware network known as “Emotet,” authorities said in a statement.\n\n“Emotet is currently seen as the most dangerous malware globally,” Germany’s BKA federal police agency said in a statement. “The smashing of the Emotet infrastructure is a significant blow against international organised Internet crime.”\n\nEmotet is used by cyber criminals to first gain access to a victim’s computer before then downloading additional malicious software, such as trojans designed to steal banking passwords or ransomware which can lock a computer until an extortion fee is paid.\n\nSecurity experts say Emotet’s operators often sell access to victims’ computers to other hackers, using a “malware-as-a-service” business model that has made them one of the world’s most prolific and damaging cybercrime groups.\n\nGerman police said infections with Emotet had caused at least 14.5 million euros ($17.56 million) of damage in their country.

Infected with malware, they act like zombies or drones that, without the knowledge of their owners, \"mindlessly\" follow the instructions of hackers.\n\nBy sending commands to large groups of such devices, called botnets, hackers can use them to carry out cyber attacks. This can include causing information technology systems to crash, breaching systems to steal data and launching ransomware attacks that cause digital files to be locked up until the hackers are paid.\n\nThe number of systems used to control botnets, also called command and control servers, found in Singapore also nearly doubled.\n\nCSA said 1,026 of these servers were recorded here last year, up from 530 in 2019.\n\nThe sharp rise in botnet drones and the servers controlling them could be due to cyber criminals seizing opportunities created by the pandemic, said Ms Genie Sugene Gan, cyber-security firm Kaspersky's head of public affairs and government relations for Asia-Pacific.\n\nShe explained that IT teams were very stretched because the pandemic caused businesses to go digital at breakneck speed.\n\n\"Perhaps, cyber security was forced to take a backseat as companies were primarily concerned with business survival and inevitably prioritised business continuity,\" said Ms Gan.\n\nShe added that hackers were also exploiting people who were fearful and anxious over the Covid-19 outbreak, which could have made them prone to phishing, scams, spam and more.\n\nOne of the main malware programs spread last year by servers that control botnets here was Emotet, which CSA said is known to use sophisticated social engineering tactics.\n\nLast year, cyber-security firms warned that hackers were using Covid-19 e-mails to trick people into downloading Emotet.\n\nAs for why hackers sited so many of the servers here to control zombie devices, Ms Gan said that this is a by-product of the country's developed digital infrastructure and its role as a regional data hub.\n\nCSA's report also said that ransomware cases in the Republic surged 154 per cent from 2019's 35 cases to hit 89 last year.\n\nWhile most of the cases reported were from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), hackers were also fishing for larger victims in the manufacturing, retail and healthcare sectors, said the agency.\n\nMr Eric Hoh, president for Asia-Pacific at cyber-security firm FireEye Mandiant, said organisations, in particular SMEs, that have lower priorities in cyber-security investments could become easy targets for ransomware.\n\nHe added that the manufacturing, retail and healthcare sectors are traditionally not IT-centric, which makes them more prone to phishing attempts, for instance.\n\nThe spike in ransomware cases here could be due to a trend of ransomware hackers becoming guns for hire as well. Mr Hoh said that this \"dramatically lowered the barriers of entry\" for hackers, so attack volumes rose tremendously.\n\nSeveral high-profile ransomware cases in recent months include the Colonial Pipeline attack in the United States in May that affected the fuel supply for about 50 million customers.\n\nOver this past weekend, a ransomware attack centred on US IT firm Kaseya, which helps other companies manage their IT networks, is estimated to have affected between 800 and 1,500 businesses worldwide.\n\nMinister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo said in a written parliamentary reply on Tuesday that steps have been taken to tackle ransomware.\n\nFor instance, CSA has directed sectors with critical information infrastructure, like energy, to boost their cyber security. The Government has also taken similar steps.\n\nShe urged organisations and members of the public to take preventive action before any ransomware attack hits.\n\nWebsite hacking a wake-up call for advertising agency\n\nA simple, default password shared by employees was possibly the weak link that allowed hackers to break into advertising and creative agency Splash Productions' website and deface it.\n\nThe incident, which happened about five to six years ago, was a wake-up call that spurred the company to drastically improve its cyber security.\n\nThis included getting physical security keys for staff to act as two-factor authentication to log into work devices, enforcing the use of strong passwords, encrypting data on computers, and setting up security software to detect suspicious activities.\n\nThe company's creative director, Mr Stanley Yap, told The Straits Times that these investments were necessary.\n\nEven though the firm's website hacking incident did not result in too much damage - there was no financial loss, for instance - the company did not want to become an easy target.\n\n\"As a partner and vendor, we should keep our security strong so that we don't become the loophole for hackers to take over our clients' microsites, websites or social media platforms (which we manage),\" explained Mr Yap.\n\nSplash has done work for many government agencies and businesses.\n\nAnd the password that might have been at the root of the firm's hacking incident? It was likely the default password \"admin\", which Splash did not change at the time.",

Getty\n\nThe same Russian ransomware that is thought to have been responsible for the City of New Orleans state of emergency last year has now struck Durham City and the County of Durham in North Carolina.\n\nAs 2019 wound down to an end, the City of New Orleans was hit by a ransomware attack, thought to be attributable to Ryuk. That attack was severe enough for Mayor LaToya Cantrell to declare a state of emergency. Now the City of Durham and Durham County, in North Carolina, have had to shut down networks after being hit by the same Russian ransomware.\n\nWhat just happened in North Carolina?\n\nThe City of Durham and Durham County Government IT systems were subject to a successful cyber-attack late Friday evening, March 6. Malware detection systems kicked in to provide immediate notification of the attack, and networks were closed down to prevent further spread.\n\nThe incident was described as a cyber malware attack, or rather \"two separate attacks\" at a press conference held by officials Monday, March 9. Thomas Bonfield, Durham City manager, said that while the malware had \"been contained \" and the city was in recovery mode, \"most city networks and phones remain intentionally offline during the initial stages of the recovery process.\" Bonfield said that the National Guard cybersecurity team was helping with the recovery effort. It should be noted, however, that critical public safety systems, including access to the 911 network, remained operational thanks to the emergency cyber-attack remediation process.\n\nKerry Goode, chief information officer for the City of Durham, said that the city had \"planned for this day to occur.\" Goode also said that the malware had been \"clearly identified\" as being Ryuk, a notorious ransomware threat. No ransom note, no demand for money, had been received by the time of the press conference, according to Goode.\n\nAround 80 \"contaminated\" servers will need to be rebuilt, and some 1,000 compromised computers are to be re-imaged, to get the city and county systems up and running as soon as possible.\n\nWhat is Ryuk, and who is behind it?\n\nRyuk is a ransomware threat that is exploited, like so many others, by getting a target to click on a link in a phishing email. More specifically, the exploit is contained within a weaponized Microsoft Office document attached to the email. This exploit will also, in the case of Ryuk, usually kick off the attempted download of a banking Trojan called Emotet and, ultimately, the equally notorious Trickbot malware.\n\nAlthough far from the only targets of Ryuk, thought to be linked to Russian cyber-criminals, many high-profile victims have been municipalities. Because Ryuk is commonly deployed as part of an attack that includes Trickbot, itself known for exfiltrating data from compromised systems, the forensic investigation is likely to be very time-consuming to determine the actual depth of the damage done.\n\nAre municipalities doing enough to protect against the ransomware threat?\n\nWhile the emergency cyber-attack response planning appears to have worked, and worked well, to contain the potential damage from a ransomware attack such as this, there are still questions that need to be answered. Not least regarding the efficiency of cyber-awareness training programs. A total of seven computers have been identified that are likely \"patient zero\" sources of the infection, with both city and county employees clicking on links in emails. It's good that in this case, it looks like both the intrusion detection and data backup systems in place worked well to shut down the attack, is there more that municipalities need to be doing in the face of increasingly sophisticated ransomware threats?\n\n\"At some point, I think the state is going to have to intervene and push effective resources and exert some procurement weight for adopting more of a shared services security model,\" Ina Thornton-Trump, CISO at Cjyax, says. More broadly speaking, rather than concentrating on the Durham attack, it this incompetence or neglect that has made the municipal attack surface so vulnerable? \"My inquires lead me to believe it's a very unhealthy blend of both,\" Thornton-Trump says, \"combined with regional disparities and budget priorities.\" In researching the situation, he tells me, the majority of spend for municipalities is found in maintaining aged and neglected infrastructure as well as new infrastructure to support urban development. \"That leaves IT, and IT security, way down on the list of priorities for funding,\" Thronton-Trump continues, \"new computers, routing and switching is not 'sexy' and is not a \"ribbon-cutting political event\" like new infrastructure is.\"\n\nAll hope is not lost, however, according to Thornton-Trump. \"Not only do municipalities have to avail themselves of state government and national government programs,\" he says, \"they need to start politicizing cybersecurity.\" This makes sense when state and national governments are certainly showing interest in investing in cyber-election security, so why not municipal services security as well?\n\nIn the meantime, I'd certainly recommend that Durham City and the County of Durham revisit their cyber-awareness training program and give everyone, from the top down, a refresh on why clicking on email links and opening Microsoft Office attachments can be so dangerous.",

(Photo by Francois PICARD / AFP) (Photo by FRANCOIS PICARD/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhen Colonial Pipeline took its gasoline lines down following a successful cyberattack last week, it became the most high-profile victim of a hacking group called DarkSide.\n\nBut DarkSide isn’t a single entity. It’s a media-savvy, semi-professional startup and software supplier for an illicit market of hackers looking for a quick easy way to breach and extort large businesses. In a ransomware game that, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Chainalysis, has seen $370 million 2020 revenue for the criminals in the form of ransom payments, DarkSide and its partners represent a dangerous new breed of underground businesses that are working together to menace legitimate organizations, across public and private sectors.\n\nThe security industry calls Darkside’s business model “ransomware-as-a-service,” as it mimics the software-as-a-service model. First, provide financially-motivated cybercriminals with the best software for stealing data and encrypting victims’ files over the internet via an easily-accessible dark web site. Second, provide the services around that software, such as tools that allow digital extortionists to communicate directly with their victims or get IT support. Third, share the rewards if a target pays the ransom. DarkSide takes most of the cut. According to FireEye, the security company whose Mandiant division is helping the Colonial Pipeline recover, partners take 25% of ransom fees less than $500,000 and 10% of ransom fees above $5 million. Though that’s a sizable cut of the proceeds, the DarkSide operators make ransomware attacks so simple, customers keep coming. “It’s a great way of making quick money,” says Peter Kruse, founder and CEO of CSIS Security Group, which says it has seen various cybercrime actors using the DarkSide ransomware service. In the case of the Colonial Pipeline, DarkSide says a client using its software mounted the attack that shut the pipeline down.\n\nTo stand out from the crowd, DarkSide has promised the best encryption speeds to lock up computers faster than anyone else. It also supports attacks on both Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. Its marketing is working. Since emerging in August 2020, it’s leaked the data of more than 80 organizations. The identities of those who paid may never be known, notes ransomware tracker Brett Callow. “They’ve hit at least 114 organizations and they’ve published data from 83, so these didn’t pay (the ransom). Which means at least 31 did,” Callow says. Given DarkSide users' ransom demands range between $200,000 to $2 million, according to security startup CyberReason, it’s possible they’ve collectively made more than $30 million in just half a year. And, with KrebsOnSecurity reporting that the group negotiated an $11 million ransom with one victim company, it’s likely higher than that estimate. (A message to the DarkSide crew didn’t receive a response.)\n\nLax security may be helping the hackers. Before DarkSide’s malware can be deployed, its customers first need to have broken into a network, and DarkSide doesn’t provide that service. Kruse says DarkSide’s partners look for vulnerable devices that can be found by scanning the web. Once those systems are found, they can be exploited and leverage gained on a target’s network. They then need to take control of other connected computers and install the DarkSide software, which wraps the victims’ data and locks it with keys targets must pay ransom to use.\n\nColonial Pipeline hasn’t yet revealed exactly how it was breached, though analyses of the company’s servers from security experts discovered a few avenues hackers could have used to poke holes in its defenses. There were, for instance, a large number of surveillance cameras attached to the company’s IT infrastructure, according to Derek Abdine from security company Censys. And Bob Maley, a former PayPal security lead and now CTO at cyber defense startup Black Kite, says he saw open remote management and file sharing servers, which, if the hackers had somehow acquired logins, could have provided a path onto Colonial’s network.\n\n“If I was going to hack that... I’d simply use a publicly available tool to connect to that port, run a little script and try all the credentials that I have, plus some of the common ... default usernames and passwords,” Maley added. That “credential stuffing” attack could then provide enough network access to start finding a way to plant the ransomware.\n\nThere’s long been concern that critical infrastructure businesses aren’t well-prepared for the kinds of attack described by Maley, even if they’re far from the most sophisticated attacks the internet sees every day. “Legacy industrial control systems and other similar infrastructures were primarily designed to keep information in and execute their control tasks dependably and consistently. Unfortunately, there were little or no provisions built in to adequately secure the systems and keep people out,” says Chris Piehota, a former FBI technology director.\n\nPersonnel is another issue. Kruse and Maley noted that Colonial didn’t appear to have anyone in charge of cybersecurity. Colonial said its chief information officer, hired in 2017, led cybersecurity efforts, undertaking a review of its defenses and increasing total spending on IT, including cybersecurity, by more than 50% in the past four years. A spokesperson told Forbes it had “robust protocols and software in place to detect and address threats proactively and reactively,” and that its third-party incident response team determined it was following “best practices” before the breach. Any speculation about the root cause of the incident would be premature and not informed by the facts, they added. They declined to comment on whether or not a ransom had been paid, and wouldn't say how much the hackers had demanded.\n\nThe hack itself is just the first part of a modern-day ransomware swindle. DarkSide and similar groups have realized that they need to control the story, play the press and apply as much pressure to victims as possible to extract a ransom.\n\nThe added threat on top of all that data loss is public shaming. DarkSide and other groups’ dark web sites aren’t just spaces for them to expose victims’ data. They’re places where they can attract media attention to amplify successes and, possibly, increase the ransoms as companies pay up to avoid reputational damage. The first of this new breed of publicity-friendly ransomware extortionist came in late 2019, with the emergence of Maze, which became infamous for attacks on U.S. schools. According to Callow, from security company Emsisoft, there are now about 30 doing much the same.\n\nAnother group, Babuk, has shown in the past month how devastating public shaming can be, after it hacked into the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. When the police didn’t pay the $4 million ransom, Babuk started releasing the personal information of officers. In a new batch of data on 22 police officers released this week, the leaked information included psychological assessments, social security numbers, financial data and marriage histories. Babuk even posted conversations between itself and the department, in which the latter apparently tried to lowball the crew with a $100,000 ransom offer. Babuk rejected the offer. The police department has previously acknowledged the attack but hadn’t responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.\n\nDarkSide has used a different tactic to try to improve its public image, presenting itself as a kind of Robinhood hacking organization, giving a small portion of stolen funds to charity, offering short sellers advance information so they can bet on a victim’s stock tanking, and promising not to attack certain industries: hospitals, funeral services, schools, universities, nonprofits and government organizations. It even claims to only permit attacks on companies it knows can afford to pay, saying “we do not want to kill your business.” As the group wrote on its dark web “press center” earlier this week: “Our goal is to make money, and not creating [sic] problems for society.” One victim, Dalton, Georgia-based carpet manufacturer Dixie Group Inc., disclosed a ransomware attempt affecting “portions of its information technology systems” earlier this year.\n\nWith the Colonial Pipeline, DarkSide apparently realized too late that one of its partners had targeted an industry that served a huge number of consumers with gasoline and subsequently promised to “introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.” Now the world has its eyes on the hacking group. In a “flash notice” to the cybersecurity industry and government agencies this week, the FBI said it has been investigating Darkside since October, just two months after it emerged. Its investigators and global partners have had increasing success against malware operators in recent months, the most significant in January, in which the U.S. Justice Department said it had participated in a multinational operation to disrupt and take down infrastructure of the malware and botnet known as Emotet.Described by experts the most dangerous malware in the world, Emotet offered criminals access to personal and company computers. As with DarkSide, many criminals paid Emotet’s operators to install ransomware. Authorities made arrests of alleged administrators, who face charges in Ukraine, though they’re yet to go on trial.\n\nDespite that case and the blueprint it laid down for future cyber investigations, the only authorities DarkSide appears to fear are Russian-speaking: Its malware won’t work if it detects its victim is Russian. This has led to accusations that the Kremlin either supports or harbors criminals that target Western businesses, something Putin’s government has staunchly denied. Dmitri Alperovitch, cofounder of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and now executive chairman at the Silverado Policy Accelerator nonprofit, says there’s no evidence DarkSide has obvious links to Russian intelligence, adding, “Given their long past history of wilful harboring of cybercrime, I don’t think it matters.”",

It also allows hackers to spy on victims and modify or copy data.\n\nThe attack has so far been most active in Japan, with scam e-mail disguised as official notifications from disability welfare service providers and public health centres. These warn unsuspecting cyber victims that infected coronavirus patients had been reported in a nearby area, inviting them to click on a link for more information.\n\nKaspersky’s malware analyst Anton Ivanov warned: “(The attack) could spread as people continue to be worried for their health.”\n\nThe World Health Organisation on Thursday declared the coronavirus epidemic in China an international emergency, with nearly 10,000 people infected and more than 200 dead. Originating in Wuhan, the coronavirus has since spread to more than 18 countries.\n\nSingCert also warned Internet users not to click on links or open attachments in dubious e-mail and messages, and advised them to refer to official sources such as the Ministry of Health website (https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhan) for the latest information on the outbreak.",

Huawei signed a pact last year to build a cable system linking Pakistan to Kenya via Djibouti. State-owned China Telecom could build fiber-optic links even in the Arctic Circle.Beijing can gather information through these cables, according to the CFR note. \"Technicians can bend or clamp the fibers to allow data to leak out or bypass encryption, the note alleged. \"Prior actions taken by the Chinese government, such as installing backdoors in encryption technology, suggest that it will take similar actions when laying down fiber optic cables in other countries.\"While these projects may benefit developing economies, \"they have raised concerns that Beijing could use these networks to exert pressure on other states or engage in electronic surveillance,\" The Economist Intelligence Unit said in a recent report. \"BRI countries will need to enhance regulatory frameworks and oversight of projects to mitigate financial risks and political dependence,\" it added.Huawei is also involved in deploying 5G mobile technology under the Digital Silk Road.

The arrangements will come into effect when the protocol is signed, an official said without giving a date.“This is one of the milestones because we are getting access to four Chinese ports in addition to two ports in India,” Rabi Shankar Sainju, a commerce ministry official, told Reuters.He said Nepali cargo from Japan, South Korea and other north Asian countries could be routed through China which would cut shipping time and costs.Overland trade is now routed mainly through the east Indian port of Kolkata which takes up to three months, officials said. New Delhi has also opened the southern port at Vishakhapatnam for Nepali trade.Traders say the plan to connect the country with China could face issues due to a lack of proper roads and customs infrastructure on the Nepalese side of the border. The nearest Chinese port is also located more than 2,600 km (1,625 miles) from its border.“Nepal must develop proper infrastructure for smooth access to Chinese ports. Without this simply opening of ports will not be useful,” said Anup Malla, an exporter of woollen carpets.China is making fast inroads into Nepal with aid and investment, challenging India’s long-held position as the dominant outside power.Beijing and Kathmandu are also in talks for building a railway link into Nepal, constructing an electric transmission line and are conducting a feasibility study for a free trade agreement.China has failed to win India's support for its ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure project, President Xi Jinping 's landmark scheme to connect China to the rest of Asia and beyond, a giant reworking of its old Silk Road India has not signed up to the initiative as parts of one key project, the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, runs through Pakistan-administered Kashmir that India considers its own territory.",

The competition between two Asian giants, India and China, for influence over tiny Nepal is yielding a bonanza in the form of the Himalayan mountain nation’s first modern railway, and possibly more to come. (Niranjan Shrestha/Associated Press)\n\nJANAKPUR, Nepal — The competition between two Asian giants, India and China, for influence over tiny Nepal is yielding a bonanza in the form of the Himalayan mountain nation’s first modern railway — and possibly more to come.\n\nNew shiny rails connecting the 34 kilometers (21 miles) between Janakpur in southeastern Nepal and Jay Nagar in the Indian state of Bihar are raising hopes for more business and pilgrimages.\n\nThe railway is India’s latest bid to keep its foothold in South Asia, a traditional sphere of influence, as China spends billions on its massive Belt and Road Initiative, an infrastructure project that aims to expand trade across a vast arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific to Africa and Europe.\n\nBiswombar Sah, a 62-year-old farmer, is among hundreds of people in Janakpur visiting the still-under-construction rail station daily to check on its progress as workers polish the marble floors, lay tiles on the platform and paint local art on the walls of the waiting room.\n\n“These train tracks are the best thing to happen to us in a very long time. We are all thrilled about getting a modern train that will make travel so much easier and cheaper,” Sah said.\n\nOnce the new $80 million rail line begins operations, plans call for extending the railway deeper into Nepal.\n\nFor now, only a dusty trail passing through villages connects Jay Nagar and Janakpur. It’s mostly used by people bringing in daily goods on motorcycles and small trucks.\n\nThe British, who ruled India from 1858-1947, built a narrow-gauge 2.5-foot wide track in 1937 to transport timber from Nepal. That train, with only three rusted carriages, windows lacking panes, missing doors and iffy service — the engine often broke down for days — quit running in 2014.\n\nMillions of Hindu devotees travel every year to the Ram Janaki temple in Janakpur, where the Hindu goddess Sita is believed to have been born and later married the Hindu god Ram.\n\nRestaurant owner Naresh Chandra Jha is one of many in Janakpur who view the railway as a godsend. He’s counting on a windfall from the pilgrimage trade, and on saving money thanks to lower transport costs for his supplies.\n\n“This is the biggest event for Janakpur,” he said. “It will be a big contribution for development and boost the number of religious visitors.”\n\nThe new line will be able to handle bigger trains carrying more passengers than the old trains, says Binod Ojha, who was supervising the project from a makeshift office at the new station. Apart from tens of thousands of Hindu pilgrims, it also will accommodate cargo — landlocked Nepal imports all of its oil, food and other goods from India, which accounts for two-thirds of its foreign trade.\n\n“Once we start operating trains, people will be able to travel from here to New Delhi or even southern India. We will be well connected,” Ojha said. “Once trains begin to bring all these things from India, the cost will naturally go down. Our daily expenses will be much cheaper.”\n\nHome to Mount Everest and other peaks on the roof of the world, Nepal has limited road networks. Politicians have been promising for years to build new train lines across the mountainous country. China and India are vying for leverage by offering to build them, and that helped spur work on the Indian-funded Janakpur-Jay Nagar line.\n\nDespite great hopes among those awaiting the new train it’s unclear exactly when passenger service will start. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been expected to travel by train to Janakpur in December to inaugurate the new line during a popular Hindu festival but that plan has been cancelled.\n\nIndia traditionally has had major influence in Nepal economically, socially and culturally. It surrounds Nepal on three sides and has open borders. Indian leaders who head the world’s biggest democracy are keen to counter what they view as Nepal’s recent tilt toward China, a communist-ruled country.\n\nIndia was instrumental in helping Nepal establish democracy in 1950 and bring it back in 1990, when a popular uprising forced the king to give up autocratic power and bring in a multiparty system. But Nepal’s communist party won control of government in elections last year.\n\nNepal’s prime minister, Khadka Prasad Oli, signed an agreement during a recent visit to Beijing on surveying for possible train links from the Nepal capital Kathmandu to the Chinese border in the north and other parts of the country.\n\nChina is building two airports, highways, city roads, hydropower plants and a cement factory. India has also invested in hydropower plants, transport and rail links.\n\nDuring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Nepal earlier this year India committed to conducting a survey on building a rail link from Kathmandu to the Indian border.\n\nThe Indian side may be falling behind in the influence sweepstakes. At an investor’s conference last year, China pledged to invest $8 billion in Nepal compared to $317 million by India. This year, according to Nepal Investment Board, China has invested $471 million while India has committed only $51 million.\n\n“Investment from both China and India are in the rising trend. It appears they are both competing with investments, but it is a healthy competition which is beneficial for Nepal,” said Uttam Wagle, a Nepal Investment Board spokesman.\n\nThe new train connection is expected to give India a boost. And when it comes to railways, it already has an advantage since Nepal’s border with China is mountainous while the frontier with India is in the plains, said Dhruba Hari Adhikary, an independent analyst based in Kathmandu.\n\n“India has overtaken China in terms of connectivity by train because they have already laid down the tracks and the system could function immediately, but the Chinese plan is still on paper only,” Adhikari said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Wei Fenghe has lauded Nepal’s leadership for resolutely pursuing the ‘one-China’ policy and offered firm support to the Himalayan country in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, the Defence Ministry said in Beijing on Monday.\n\nMr. Wei, who is also a State Councillor, met Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and exchanged views on matters of mutual interest and held talks with Army chief Gen. Purna Chandra Thapa on ways to resume military cooperation and training impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during his one-day visit to Nepal on Sunday.\n\nAccording to a Chinese Defence Ministry statement, Mr. Wei told the Nepalese leaders that China highly appreciates Nepal for resolutely pursuing the ‘one-China’ policy, and also firmly supports Nepal to safeguard its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nUnder the ‘one-China’ policy, Beijing emphasises other countries to recognise Taiwan and Tibet as part of China, it said.\n\nAs China firmed up its ties with Nepal, which shares borders with Tibet, with heavy investments besides loans and financial assistance, Beijing wants Kathmandu to stop the free-flow of Tibetans to travel to Dharamshala in India to meet Tibet’s highest spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, the statement said. Nepal also has a large chunk of Tibetan population.\n\nThe 85-year-old Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 following a crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet. India granted him political asylum and the Tibetan government-in exile is based in Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh since then.\n\nChina views the 14th Dalai Lama as a “separatist” working to split Tibet from China.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry statement, giving details about Mr. Wei’s visit to Nepal, said that he told the Nepalese leaders that China will continue to keep close communications with the Nepalese side and provide support and assistance for the military development of Nepal and make more contributions to the benefits of both peoples and regional peace and stability.\n\nHe held bilateral talks with Nepal Army chief Gen. Thapa during his “working visit” to Nepal, the highest-level visit from China after President Xi Jinping’s two-day state visit that took place in October last year.\n\nMr. Wei’s visit, however, received low-key coverage in the Chinese state media.\n\nHis visit comes days after India’s Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla wrapped up his maiden two-day visit to Nepal.\n\nIn the first week of November, Indian Army chief Gen. M M Naravane paid a three-day visit to Nepal aimed at resetting bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row between the two countries.\n\nMr. Wei’s visit also comes amidst an ongoing political rift in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) that resurfaced following a meeting between Prime Minister Oli and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’\n\nChina’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in the recent years with billions of dollars of investments under Beijing’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including the building of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.\n\nBesides the investments, China’s ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi has made open efforts to garner support for Mr. Oli, who faced a massive rebellion in his party from the faction led by ‘Prachanda’, also a former Prime Minister.",

State-run Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) was to have built it.\n\nBut Prime Minister K.P.

He did not give further details of the decision taken by the cabinet on Friday night.\n\nChina and India are both jostling for influence in Nepal by providing aid and investment in infrastructure projects.\n\nOfficials said a formal construction deal will be signed on the hydropower project after the government had negotiated the project modalities with the Chinese company.

The Himalayan nation is said to have dropped those plans following apprehensions they could infringe on its sovereignty.While 18 pacts were signed following Xi’s summit meetings with Nepalese PM K P Sharma Oli in Kathmandu on Sunday, the proposed extradition treaty was not inked and instead a pact on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal matters was signed. ET has learnt that there were apprehensions in sections of the Nepalese government that the extradition treaty will be used to clamp down against Tibetans and deportation of Tibetans to China. Nepal shares a long border with Tibet and is home to around 20,000 Tibetan exiles.There were apprehensions in sections of Nepalese government and polity over proposed defence agreement, pact on border road construction, opening of more port access by China to Nepal in special terms and Beijing’s assistance for construction of the National Defence University or NDU (equivalent of NDC) for Nepal. The two sides held active dialogue on NDU till few days before the visit but Kathmandu later shelved the idea due to local opposition. Chinese were also supposed to construct or atleast fund part of the construction cost of the new Parliament building but even that proposal did not make much headway. Former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai had urged the government not to sign the treaty for now as discussions for a similar agreement with India were ongoing.Nepal signed an extradition treaty with India on October 2, 1953, when Matrika Prasad Koirala was the prime minister. India, however, has been demanding a revision to the treaty. In 2006, Nepal and India were close to signing an Extradition Treaty and the Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance. Negotiations, however, failed due to disagreements among the parties in Nepal. Similar attempts collapsed in 2008 and 2010.It is for no reason that the proposed pacts were shelved at the last minute. Nepal has witnessed a series of anti-China protests in recent months over a slew of issues from protests against Huawei to financial fraud in which Chinese nationals are involved. Besides a section of Nepal Communist Party leaders, including its elected representatives in Province 1 have expressed serious concerns over big dam, construction constructed by China at Arun River.",

This is the question western government around the world are grappling with, and now New Zealand is too.\n\nThe first outward sign of this was news the Security Intelligence Service and the New Zealand Immigration Service is investigating a Chinese PhD student, Hu Bin at Auckland University of Technology. His research on 5G technology has military applications.\n\n5G networks could be used as a weapon, or a point of attack, in a time of military conflict. China is linked to multiple cyber attacks on the US and other nations, including New Zealand. China has a dominant position in network infrastructure and is now expanding this via the Digital Silk Road; part of the globe-spanning Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe Digital Silk Road could provide enhanced missile positioning, timing and enhanced C4ISR capabilities for the Chinese military, as well as navigation services to more than 69 countries along the Belt and Road, including partners in Oceania. The New Zealand Coalition government is currently mulling whether to sign up to the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHu's research apparently came to attention because under the Strategic Goods Regulations, New Zealand entities — including universities — are prohibited from the development, production, or deployment of any goods or know-how with a military end use unless a permit has been obtained from the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade. New Zealand's Strategic Goods Regulations are based on the Wassenaar Arrangement, and the control measures of the Australia Group, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime.\n\nSignatories to the Wassenaar Arrangement commit to not exporting dual-use goods, technologies, or know-how to non-Wassenaar members. China is not a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement.\n\nChina is New Zealand's largest export market, absorbing 22 per cent of all our exports. It is also New Zealand's largest market for foreign students and New Zealand's sixth largest foreign scientific research partner.\n\nThe New Zealand government has long-encouraged New Zealand universities to partner with their Chinese counterparts on science and technology projects. New Zealand and China signed a Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement in 1987, and updated it in 2003. The New Zealand-China Strategic Research Alliance (SRA) was set up in 2010. The SRA aims to increase scientific research partnerships and greater commercialisation of science between China and New Zealand.\n\nMost of these partnerships are benign. However cases like that of Mr Hu demonstrate that there are areas of concern where research links have a possible military end use application. There is a need for a conversation about national security concerns between the government and New Zealand's scientific community. Changes in policy in China are accelerating the urgency of this conversation.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping declared China's new civil-military integration policy in March 2015 and official documents issued in December 2017 codified the strategy. Xi's announcement was an acknowledgement of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government's longstanding approach of utilising the civil sector to acquire and develop military technology and know-how both in China and abroad.\n\nPeople's Liberation Army (PLA) institutions, including PLA-affiliated and linked universities, work closely with non-military universities and companies in China. Through their contacts abroad, Chinese universities and companies provide a channel that can allow the PLA to benefit from research conducted outside China.\n\nIn recent years most of New Zealand's universities have established partnerships with Chinese universities that are linked to the PLA. These range from the PLA Institute of Military Culture (Massey); the National University of Defence Technology (Auckland, Massey); North-western Polytechnical University (Canterbury), Shenyang Aerospace University (UNITEC), to Xidian University (Otago, VUW). A similar pattern of relationships is found in Australian universities.\n\nNew Zealand academics supervise doctoral students who were graduates of PLA-linked universities before coming to New Zealand, and they host graduate students and staff currently working at such institutions on short term fellowships. Some New Zealand academics have joint appointments or advisory roles at PLA-linked universities.\n\nSeveral New Zealand universities are now in partnership with Chinese companies, such as Iflytek and Huawei who are understood to have links with the Chinese military sector. Several PLA-linked universities have also set up alumni associations in New Zealand to maintain connections with former staff and students.\n\nThe New Zealand government needs to re-examine its policies on encouraging scientific exchanges with Chinese universities in the light of China's changed policies to merge military and civil research.\n\nConnections between Chinese military-affiliated universities and New Zealand universities expose New Zealand to potential security risks. While most links are not of concern, some potentially breach our international obligations forbidding the export of military end use goods, technologies and know-how. They may also have a negative impact on international sources of funding, if funding providers are uncomfortable with the potential that the knowledge obtained will be shared with China.\n\nNew Zealand universities must partner with the government to come up with a solution which will uphold academic freedom and intellectual property rights, at the same time as dealing with the security concerns.",

                        "docText": "One of Canada's closest allies has declined to back Canada in its ongoing dispute with China, despite at least one personal call to its leader by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nAlthough New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is often seen as a natural partner for Trudeau's progressive brand of politics, and her country is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network with Canada, the Pacific nation appears reluctant to publicly criticize China over the dispute.\n\nMichael Kovrig and a second Canadian, Michael Spavor, were arrested in China in December after Canadian officials detained technology giant Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S. She was granted bail and is awaiting court proceedings.\n\nNew Zealand's neutrality in the dispute stands in contrast to the position taken by most of Canada's other allies and the other members of the Five Eyes, the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\nNew Zealand has employed a low-key version of the pressure campaign China used against Canada to effect Meng's release, after the small Pacific nation banned tech giant Huawei in 2018 from involvement in its 5G network.\n\nMemorandums for Trudeau\n\nThrough access to information, CBC News obtained memorandums prepared for Trudeau as he made outreach calls to world leaders seeking public statements of support in the Huawei dispute.\n\nThe memorandums relate to calls made following the arrests of the two Canadians and through to the end of January, a period when Canada was trying to show China its actions were isolating it in the world.\n\n\"We are asking partners to reinforce that: China should have confidence that Ms. Meng will be treated fairly in Canadian courts. For Canada, this is an exclusively judicial matter — not a political one,\" reads the memo for Trudeau's Jan. 16 conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nIt said Canada wants its allies to support the position that Michael Kovrig should be covered by diplomatic immunity.\n\nAllies rally round\n\nSome calls were fruitful. A Jan. 30 memo prepared for a follow-up call with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, reminded Trudeau that shortly after speaking to Tusk on Jan. 19 about China he tweeted out the EU's support, echoing the call to release both men.\n\nCanada also received support from the U.S., Germany, the U.K., France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and the three Baltic nations.\n\n“The German Government is convinced 🇨🇦 will ensure that Meng Wanzhou has a fair, unbiased and transparent judicial procedure. For the two Canadians who have been arrested in China, we urge that they be treated fairly and in compliance with the rule of law.” <a href=\"https://t.co/5ittUnJhsX\">pic.twitter.com/5ittUnJhsX</a> —@GermanyDiplo\n\nNot all allies were equally helpful. Calls to the leaders of Italy, Finland, Japan, and Singapore produced only tepid statements or none at all.\n\nA government official speaking on background said Canada initially struggled to get backing from a country it might have expected to count on: Australia.\n\nDespite Canadian pressure and criticism from Australian media, Foreign Minister Marise Payne remained mute on the issue for weeks. Then on Dec. 29, an open letter was published by more than 30 of Australia's most respected academics and analysts working on Chinese issues, calling on her government \"without further delay to support Canada's call for the immediate release of these two detainees.\"\n\nThe following day Payne expressed her \"concern\" over the detentions, but still stopped short of calling for their release.\n\nIf Australia's response was disappointingly lukewarm, New Zealand has been even less helpful.\n\nGood phone call with PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinTrudeau</a>. Both Canada and EU stand by the rule of law underpinning the global order. EU calls for the release of the Canadian citizens detained in China. —@eucopresident\n\nA spokesperson for New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade told CBC News that \"New Zealand and Canada have discussed the detention and legal treatment of Canadian citizens in China, and the need for all countries to respect judicial procedure and rule of law.\"\n\nThat \"all countries\" language differs from the comments of other Canadian allies that focused on the need for China to respect due process, while emphasizing that Canada was already doing so.\n\nA memorandum prepared for Trudeau's Jan. 11 call with Ardern, detailing \"Suggested Talking Points\" for the call is redacted in its entirety, citing an exemption to Canada's Access to Information Act.\n\nN.Z.-China ties close but strained\n\nNew Zealand's reluctance may reflect its close links with China. It backed Beijing's bid to join the World Trade Organization, they have had free trade since 2008 and Mandarin is taught in New Zealand's schools.\n\nBut a recent dispute that has strained those close ties, and the desire not to strain them further, may also be a factor.\n\nIn November, New Zealand joined the U.S., Germany and others in excluding Huawei from contracts for its new 5G network. Huawei had previously worked on New Zealand's 3G and 4G upgrades.\n\n2018, the official \"Canada-China Year of Tourism,\" ended on a sour note because of Huawei. And 2019, the \"China-New Zealand Year of Tourism,\" began on an equally sour note for similar reasons. The opening ceremony and a proposed visit by Ardern to China were postponed by the Chinese side.\n\nSince then, Ardern has appeared to soften the position taken by her spy chiefs. \"There's been no final decision here yet\" on Huawei, she said in February, suggesting the Chinese company still had a chance to bid on 5G.\n\nMagic weapons\n\nBut China's ire was sparked not only by the Huawei ban, but also by a growing realization in New Zealand that the country has been complacent about Chinese government influence.\n\nMany public figures in the country have rallied to the defence of Anne-Marie Brady, a China expert at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. Her 2017 research paper Magic Weapons: China's political influence activities under Xi Jinping, revealed China's success at putting Beijing-friendly figures into influential positions.\n\nSubsequent burglaries of her home and office, as well as apparent tampering with her car, prompted New Zealand's Security Intelligence Service to sweep her home and office for recording devices.\n\nThe Hoover Institution in the United States also produced a report on Chinese penetration of New Zealand, noting that Australia and New Zealand are more vulnerable than other Western countries, but \"New Zealand's government, unlike that of Australia, has taken few steps to counter foreign interference in its internal affairs.\"\n\n'Soft underbelly'\n\nCanada's spy agency has also expressed concerns about New Zealand. Last May CSIS published China and the Age of Strategic Rivalry, which was remarkably critical of New Zealand.\n\n\"New Zealand provides a vivid case study of China's willingness to use economic ties to interfere with the political life of a partner country,\" said the report.\n\n\"Chinese Communist Party leadership regards New Zealand as an exemplar of how it would like relations to be with other states in the future. The PRC's political influence activities in New Zealand have now reached a critical level,\" it added, detailing China's use of universities, business ties, political donations and the local Chinese community to obtain leverage over public policy in the island nation.\n\n\"Some of these activities endanger New Zealand's national security directly, while others have a more long-term corrosive effect.\"\n\nThe report also described New Zealand as the \"soft underbelly\" of the Five Eyes network, suggesting its membership in the group made it a more tantalizing target for Chinese espionage.\n\nThe report embarrassed New Zealand and forced Ardern to issue a denial. \"I have had no indication that our Five Eyes membership is under question, from Canada or any other of our partners, nor have I heard that it has been raised with any of my colleagues.\"\n\nA Canadian official speaking on background said Canada has no desire to publicly criticize or embarrass New Zealand.\n\nCanada's approach \"includes seeking public statements of support,\" the official told CBC News, \"but also includes private engagement and advice,\" adding that New Zealand counterparts had shared with the Canadians some of their own lessons learned from dealing with the Chinese.",

Though this is being reviewed every two days.\n\nThe travel ban will throw many students' plans into disarray. Some polytech courses have already begun, and some universities start their first semester on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n• Coronavirus: New cases fall; WHO says China bought the world time\n\n• Premium - Coronavirus - What does it mean for Bay of Plenty people?\n\n• Coronavirus vaccine still a year away, amid fears it could mutate\n\n• Coronavirus: Big collapse of Chinese restaurants looms as customers stay away over virus fears\n\nLatest figures (from 2018) show 18 percent of university enrolments were international students - and Chinese students made up almost 50 percent of those.\n\nEven if there are no further extensions to the travel ban, it's likely some students will have changed their plans to study here, Tertiary Education Union president Michael Gilchrist said. And if the restrictions continue he's worried the impact will be significant.\n\nGilchrist said the potential damage would be worse because it comes on the back of visa tightening and processing delays last year, which the TEU estimates cost tertiary institutes between $100 and $120 million - and if the travel restrictions are extended he warned there could be similar losses this year.\n\n\"We have become over-reliant financially, on international students in general, and Chinese students in particular; Chinese students make up a significant proportion of the expected income of some universities and polytechnics.\"\n\nThe TEU blames decades of government underfunding for forcing the tertiary sector to depend on lucrative foreign fees.\n\nInternational student fees should be seen as the cherry on top, not the bread and butter institutions must rely on to get by - precisely because it exposes universities and polytechs to market wobbles like this, Gilchrist has been saying for some time.\n\nBalancing act for government\n\nUniversities of New Zealand director Chris Whelan said the government has a difficult balancing act on their hands as they reviewed the travel restrictions - juggling public health concerns over the spread of the disease, the economic impact of the bans, and the impact it will have on students lives. But the timing couldn't be worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's difficult - as a university sector we have 6500 university students who are currently stuck in China because of the travel ban, and we're still not sure how long it's going to take before we can get our students here.\"\n\nEven once the restrictions end, students will need time to organise travel, many airlines have suspended services to China. Those entering the country from China may still be asked to self-isolate for 14 days after their arrival - the duration it could take for carriers to show signs of the disease - delaying their arrival at classes further.\n\n\"It's a massive disruption of their lives and their plans. The longer it carries on, the harder it's going to be,\" he said.\n\n\"We're working very closely with government, talking on a daily basis about the situation, and letting our students know what's going on. From our point of view we hope the ban is as short as possible, but we do understand the government has to be prudent.\"\n\nIt's likely some students will opt to study in countries where no travel restrictions are in place.\n\n\"It's very definitely a risk for us - countries like the UK and Canada have not imposed a travel ban.\n\n\"In the Northern Hemisphere they're half-way through their academic year, but if this ban goes on too long Chinese students would be able to start in those countries come July or August, when the Northern Hemisphere universities begin their academic year.\"\n\nWhelan agreed the sector has been forced to rely on fees from international students.\n\n\"If we do lose significant numbers of students it's going to be a very significant financial challenge, not just for universities but for the whole tertiary education sector and the schooling sector as well.\n\n\"We are now extremely dependant on being able to get those students here to be able to remain financially viable. Our government funding per student has been declining in real terms over the last 15 - 20 years, to the point where we're now funded below the OECD average. \"\n\nThe long-term decline in funding to universities was matched by the slow slip of New Zealand universities in prestigious international rankings, Whelan said, which created a compounding vulnerability for universities recruiting international students to prop their incomes up.\n\nAlready the coronavirus travel ban was causing problems for universities trying to estimate class sizes and the teachers needed, he said.\n\nGilchrist expects if there is no government funding increase to help institutions cope, universities and especially polytechs will be forced to reduce teacher to student ratios, and staff who he says are already asked to do more to make up for funding gaps, will be pushed away from teaching.\n\nInternational students prepare to return\n\nUniversity of Auckland student Elise Chow hoped to come back to New Zealand this week. She was at home in Hong Kong, which is so far not included in the restrictions on mainland China.\n\nBut there have been 56 coronavirus cases in Hong Kong. So she has been avoiding going out in public, wearing a face mask when she does, and was watching the updates on travel restrictions to New Zealand anxiously in case they are extended to Hong Kong.\n\nMany of her friends had been delayed from travelling back to New Zealand to start their study, they kept in touch online, but her friends were very worried.\n\nChow hoped to finish her nutrition degree this year, and was paying rent on a flat in Auckland while she was away for the holidays.\n\n\"Personally I do feel worried and confused. I've been concerned about it. I want to come back before classes start.\"\n\nChow said because she's in her final year of her degree she can't just go elsewhere. If she is delayed from returning she will have to wait at home until the start of the next semester and delay her graduation plans, which would be \"frustrating, but there's nothing much I can do about it\".\n\nThe World Health Organisation has made it clear it does not support international travel restrictions, but does recommend screening for symptomatic patients, who can be isolated.\n\nAnd China's consul general in Auckland, Ruan Ping, said the decision was disappointing, and bad for both countries.\n\nBut despite being among those who could bear the brunt, Chow felt differently; \"I do understand it's fair for New Zealand - you guys want to protect the residents.\"\n\nAdvice for students issued\n\nAdvice for students about the travel restrictions is provided on the Immigration New Zealand and Universities of New Zealand websites, and health advice about the coronavirus is available through a dedicated New Zealand Healthline which is accessible to overseas callers.\n\n- RNZ",

And after he attended a rally on campus last week, photos of his fellow pro-democracy protesters at another Melbourne campus were posted on a WeChat group that supports Beijing's rule, identifying them as \"poisonous\" separatists.\n\n\"It's pretty dark,\" Mr Kwong said, noting he was also followed and photographed while at the rally. His concerns show the heated tensions that have erupted in Hong Kong are also bubbling away among an increasingly fractured Chinese diaspora.\n\nPro-democracy protests are planned in four Australian cities on Friday evening (Aug 16), launching a weekend of global protests that will include vigils in the US, Europe, Canada and Japan under the banner \"Global Solidarity With Hong Kong.\" Meanwhile, pro-China rallies are being organised in Sydney, where boards hosting messages in support of independence campaigners have been vandalised.\n\nSo far, the violent scenes that have played out almost daily in Hong Kong - fueling anxiety over the possibility of military intervention by President Xi Jinping - have been avoided elsewhere. Yet heated exchanges on university campuses in Australia, New Zealand and Canada have led to accusations that Beijing may be attempting to stoke nationalist sentiment beyond its borders.\n\n\"A lot of people from mainland China who live abroad, including students, are angry about what's going on in Hong Kong, and it's not surprising they're clashing with pro-democracy supporters,\" said Mr Ben Bland, a director at Sydney-based think tank the Lowy Institute and author of \"Generation HK: Seeking Identity in China's Shadow.\"\n\n\"If the situation in Hong Kong continues to get more heated, it will inevitably get more difficult for universities and governments to manage those tensions.\"\n\nAt a university campus in Brisbane last month, protesters from both sides hurled verbal abuse at each other and punches were thrown. After China's consul general in Brisbane, Mr Xu Jie, stated his support of \"the spontaneous patriotic behaviour of Chinese students,\" Foreign Minister Marise Payne warned that overseas diplomats shouldn't encourage \"disruptive or potentially violent behaviour.\"\n\nA similar scenario played out in New Zealand. After pro-Beijing students clashed with supporters of the Hong Kong protesters at the University of Auckland, the Chinese consulate said pro-democracy demonstrators were \"demonising the images of China\" and \"inciting anti-China sentiment.\"\n\nThe Auckland campus has also seen vandals deface its \"Lennon Wall,\" a local version of the pro-democracy message boards that have popped up all over Hong Kong. Sydney's version in the central business district has been removed.\n\nRelated Story Beijing will not sit by and watch if Hong Kong crisis worsens: Chinese envoy\n\nRelated Story More people in Hong Kong begin to take a stand as unrest mounts in the territory\n\nAt Vancouver's Simon Fraser University, attacks on its Lennon Wall have seen activists create a mobile billboard that's monitored by day and rolled away at night, Ms Sylvia Ceacero, the student society's executive director, said by phone on Wednesday.\n\nTensions among the diaspora have increased in recent years in Vancouver, a city where one in five have Chinese heritage. There are divisions between the Cantonese-speaking population - many of whom fled Hong Kong ahead of the 1997 handover from the UK to China - and the mainland-based, predominantly Mandarin-speaking migrants and students who have more recently arrived.\n\nHong Kong's now-suspended extradition bill, which sparked the city's protests, isn't an abstract threat for many Canadians. An estimated 300,000 Hong Kong residents hold Canadian citizenship - a survey in 2011 showed that nearly 8 per cent of Hong Kong households have at least one Canadian citizen over the age of 18.\n\nThe prospect that such Canadians could potentially be handed over to China has prompted alarm, especially given the fate of two Canadians presently in Beijing's custody. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor have spent eight months in a jail with only a handful of consular visits, their detention widely seen as a tit-for-tat reprisal for Canada's arrest of a Huawei Technologies Co executive on a US extradition request.\n\nHuawei has also sat at the centre of controversy in Australia, with Beijing angered after the government banned the state-linked company from building its 5G network.\n\nPROTESTERS WARNED\n\nThe most China-dependent developed economy and a key ally of the US, Australia last year legislated anti-foreign interference laws designed to restrict Beijing's meddling in its government, media and universities. Australia hosts more than 250,000 Chinese students, who make up about 29 per cent of the total international-student intake in an industry that reaped almost US$24 billion (S$33.34 billion) last year.\n\nRelated Story Hong Kong: A city divided as more take sides amid growing unrest\n\nThe Communist Party's United Front - a collection of affiliated parties and overseas influence groups - has been accused of seeking to sway public opinion in Australia. Meanwhile, the Sydney Morning Herald reported this month that a China-based mother of one of the protesters who attended the Brisbane rally received a warning from officials that her son shouldn't engage in \"anti-China rhetoric.\"\n\nMs Jane Golley, an economist and director of the Australian National University's Australian Centre on China in the World in Canberra, said while it was evident the tensions in Hong Kong had spread globally, the right to protest remained fundamental for Western universities.\n\n\"There are bigger things to be concerned about than a number of Chinese students protesting at Australian universities,\" Ms Golley said, adding that the Brisbane student's report of being warned through his mother was a \"repression of freedom that makes me nervous.\"",

Others cast it as an attempt by China to develop soft power, and even as a means of projecting its industrial strategy.\n\nRegardless of where one stands, no one doubts the BRI is here to stay. It is now seen as a central pillar of China's economic strategy, supported at the highest levels of the Chinese Government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBRI is increasingly the framework through which China engages with the rest of the world.\n\nToday New Zealand is facing greater competition than ever for attention in China.\n\nAustralia has negotiated a very good FTA, Chile has already upgraded its FTA, European states are making a huge push to develop people-to-people links, and Latin American countries are already staking out their roles in the BRI.\n\nWhere does this leave us? There's no doubt we can be on the BRI map if we want to be.\n\nOn the other hand, if we choose not to engage, others almost certainly will and we could find our position in the Chinese market further eroded.\n\nThe smart option is to try to develop our participation in a way that builds on our comparative advantage and matches our interests and values.\n\nThe ability to co-operate for mutual benefit despite fundamental differences is a hallmark of the New Zealand-China relationship, and our involvement in BRI need not be any different.\n\nOn the upside there will be tangible benefits to a number of our key sectors, as long as we develop carefully our thinking around the specifics of our contribution and how this can be presented to our Chinese partners.\n\nSo where do we begin? Premier Li Keqiang's visit a year ago provided the two governments with a non-binding Memorandum of Arrangement, which gives us a mechanism firstly to define our contribution, and secondly to present this under a framework for bilateral co-operation.\n\nThe New Zealand China Council is working on a strategic pathway to identify the big opportunities for New Zealand. We expect these are more likely to be in \"soft infrastructure\" rather than \"hard infrastructure\" — the way goods, services, capital and people move along the belt and road, rather than building the road itself.\n\nSpecifically, four areas where New Zealand can make a unique contribution are: trade facilitation and supply chain connectivity, linking China with South America, innovation, and the creative sector.\n\nTrade facilitation could leverage our world class biosecurity regime, expertise in cross-border movement of goods, and experience in working across jurisdictions on trade hubs. Our geographic location and trade and tourism relationships with China and South America position us as a natural connection between the two.\n\nIn the innovation space, New Zealand can utilise its strong capability in science and technology and advance our existing collaboration and commercial links in these areas.\n\nFor the creative sector, opportunities exist to use creative properties to expand people to people links, cultural awareness, understanding and exchange.\n\nThese areas will need further thought and refinement, as well as identifying who should pursue the opportunities — government, business, universities or cities. The NZ China Council will release a report in May setting out our final recommendations.\n\nAs we move forward to implementing our BRI strategy, we will of course need to continue to monitor developments in China, and give thought to any risks in pursuing this course.\n\nOne obvious risk may be to underestimate or overestimate the value of participation.\n\nThe BRI, much like our wider relationship with China, should not replace other important relationships and arrangements with the rest of the world. We can pursue BRI and initiatives like CPTPP at the same time.\n\nBRI will not require us to surrender our sovereignty or our independent foreign policy. It is up to New Zealand and New Zealanders alone to make the running and come up with ideas for how we can take part and add value to our existing relationship. This is work we have to do ourselves.\n\nIt will require innovative new thinking, open minds and classic Kiwi ingenuity as we work together to chart our own path along the Belt and Road.\n\nStephen Jacobi is Executive Director of the NZ China Council",

For myself, it was being at kindergarten one day when a foreign man came to visit. He took photos for us, played games and ended up staying for a whole week. I clearly remember his warm smile, blue eyes and the fluent Chinese he spoke.\n\nIn China's Hunan Province in the 1960s, foreigners were a very rare sight, so this was an experience none of us could forget easily. Later, my mother told me this \"grandpa with a big nose\" was from a country far away called New Zealand. She said his name was Rewi Alley, and he'd come to China to dedicate his life to Chinese people's liberation and building New China.\n\nOf course, he also played a pioneering role in bringing New Zealand and China closer together, as well as China's deepened friendship with the rest of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazingly, these experience in my childhood influenced the path I took later on. From that moment of encounter with Rewi Alley, New Zealand became a place of fascination for me, and I encouraged myself to follow his example as someone who looked outward and fought for the ideals of peace, justice, friendship and common development.\n\nAfter graduating from university, I joined the diplomatic service. That was a time of China starting the era of reform and opening up to the outside world, a time of new thinking, optimism and closer relations between China and many other countries, including New Zealand.\n\nIn 2015, I was luckily appointed Consul General of the Peoples' Republic of China in Auckland. This is a huge personal honour for me. I took up with the memory of Rewi Alley sharp in my mind and determined to do the same to New Zealand just as he made a lasting impact on China.\n\nFortunately, decades of hard work by leaders of both countries have already laid the foundations for a relationship that stands out among China's ties to other developed nations.\n\nThe many 'firsts' we share, from New Zealand supporting China's accession to the WTO in 1997, to the recent announcement of negotiations to upgrade our FTA, show that New Zealand's relationship with China is an innovative one.\n\nThe challenge I set myself here was to continue the spirit of innovation by finding new opportunities to build connections between New Zealand and China.\n\nNew Zealander Rewi Alley. Photo / Bill Beavis\n\nA starting point for me has been the famous Chinese saying \"If you want to prosper, first build a road.\" New Zealand will always be defined by its geographic isolation, so helping build greater connectivity between New Zealand and China has been a defining goal and idea of my posting.\n\nThe most convenient and efficient road between New Zealand and China is clearly aviation and shipping. So for more than three years, I have put a huge amount of energy into strengthening air and maritime links between Auckland and major cities in China.\n\nEvery time I received a delegation from Chinese provinces and cities or met with the heads of Major Chinese airlines, local officials, airport managers and business leaders, I championed greater connectivity as a means to benefiting people in both countries.\n\nThe results speak for themselves, with the number of direct flights between Auckland and major Chinese cities quadrupling in just a few years to as many as 160 a week during peak times. This has not only helped meet the growing demand for New Zealand tourism and ultra-premium export products such as live seafood, but also brought greater choice and competition for Kiwi passengers and generated sustainable employment and income for local tourism operators and producers.\n\nAccording to Auckland Airport, every flight brings in an average income of about $180 million annually. Looking ahead, Auckland has a real opportunity to become an international aviation hub to link China and East Asia with South America, similar to Dubai, Singapore or Paris today.\n\nThis prospect is a good example of how cooperation between New Zealand and China fits into the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China's vision to promote closer ties between countries through development-led trade growth.\n\nAir connectivity is just one of the many ways New Zealand can leverage the BRI to grow cooperation with China, as well as the many other countries that are participating in the initiative.\n\nA number of Kiwi academic institutions and think tanks are currently working on plans and ideas for New Zealand's participation under the BRI and I'm confident this will give full play to the massive potential the initiative presents.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by the Asia New Zealand Foundation, 44 per cent of New Zealanders have already heard of the BRI.\n\nMy memory of Rewi Alley has also inspired me to explore as much of New Zealand as possible during my time in the country. Just as Alley's diaries reveal visits to numerous parts of China, covering remote areas and vast distances, I have made a point of visiting almost every town, city and corner in my consular districts, from the Far North to Waikato.\n\nAt Waitangi Day celebrations, the Auckland Lantern Festival and events like Balloons over Waikato, the warmness and hospitality of New Zealanders have touched me deeply. I've also been invited into the homes of Māori friends and experienced true manaakitanga, reminding me that Rewi Alley himself was named after a respected Māori Chief.\n\nI've also been privileged to attend important meetings, such as the China Business Summit, and the Tripartite Economic Summits of Auckland, Guangzhou and Los Angeles. I have received many important delegations from China including the one led by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, hosted dozens of receptions for the distinguished guests, and facilitated agreements between companies, universities, institutes and governments between our two countries.\n\nThese meetings and interactions are where the new ideas and energy for the next chapter of the relationship are shared and formed, and would not be possible without the lifelong work of people like Rewi Alley and others. They put people's wellbeing at the center of their work, and this continues to be a key purpose of Chinese diplomacy today.\n\nWith the joint efforts continuing on both sides, our history of innovative and pragmatic cooperation has delivered remarkable achievements. Thanks to the growth of direct flights, fresh milk from the Waikato can now be enjoyed by families in Shanghai just 72 hours after milking. Other products like fresh beef, mutton, seafood, fruit and more can easily be exported to China's booming consumer markets.\n\nJust look at the two-way trade figures, which ticked over $30 billion last year, a full two years earlier than forecast. Then consider that trade is just one part of the connections New Zealand and China are making, with new grown exchanges in culture, education, tourism, film, science, and so on every year.\n\nAuckland's Lantern Festival attracts more than 200,000 people every year. Photo / File\n\nThese are things that benefit New Zealanders from all walks of life, from farmers and entrepreneurs to engineers and film producers.\n\nA final way my memory of Rewi Alley has shaped my time in New Zealand is through promoting greater cultural understanding between Chinese and New Zealanders. Alley pioneered people-to-people exchanges many decades ago, and I have worked hard to find new ways for our two countries to learn about our distinct cultures and histories.\n\nDuring Premier Li Keqiang's visit to New Zealand in 2017, under the facilitation by our Embassy and Consulate, an agreement was signed to establish a Chinese cultural centre in Auckland, which makes New Zealand the first western country to have two Chinese cultural centres.\n\nAuckland's popular Lantern Festival has become one of the biggest celebrations in New Zealand, attracting more than 200,000 people every year.\n\nChinese Language Week encourages Kiwis to give Mandarin a go, and through the Confucius Institute in Auckland, thousands of local students have taken part in global Chinese speech competitions.\n\nTourism also plays a large role in growing cultural understanding. 2019 is the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism, encouraging people in both countries to experience the difference of our respective landscapes, histories, cultures and cuisines.\n\nIt is estimated that the number of two-way visitors will reach one million in the coming years, and this can only help to reduce barriers of understanding and foster greater friendship between us.\n\nThe co-operation on film between our two countries are booming which is and will act as another driving force for our economy, people and friendship.\n\nSadly, my time in Auckland is coming to an end. When I leave, I will do so knowing I have made a positive impact on China-New Zealand relations, inspired by my own memory of Rewi Alley, who would be amazed at the current relationship if he were still alive today.\n\nAs inheritors of his legacy, we should all keep his memory alive by maintaining the strong momentum in the relationship, so as to make greater contribution to peace and development in Asia-Pacific and throughout the world.",

The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing law enforcement sources, said she is accused of trying to evade U.S. curbs on trade with Iran.\n\nThe timing is awkward following the announcement of a U.S.-Chinese cease-fire in a tariff war over Beijing's technology policy. Meng was detained in Vancouver on Saturday, the day Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met in Argentina and announced their deal.\n\nAsian stock markets tumbled on the news, fearing renewed U.S.-Chinese tensions that threaten global economic growth. Market indexes in Tokyo and Hong Kong by 1.9 percent and 2.8 percent and Shanghai was off 1.7 percent at midday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Ottawa said Meng broke no U.S. or Canadian laws and demanded Canada \"immediately correct the mistake\" and release her.\n\n\"The Chinese side expresses firm opposition and strongly protests this serious violation of human rights,\" said an embassy statement.\n\nHuawei Technologies Ltd., the biggest global supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies, has been the target of deepening U.S. security concerns. Washington has pressured European countries and other allies to limit use of its technology.\n\nThe U.S. sees Huawei and smaller Chinese tech suppliers as possible fronts for Chinese spying and as commercial competitors that the Trump administration says benefit from improper subsidies and market barriers.\n\nTrump's tariff hikes this year on Chinese imports stemmed from complaints Beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology. But American officials also worry more broadly about Chinese plans for state-led industry development they worry might erode U.S. industrial leadership.\n\nU.S. leaders also worry that Beijing is using the growth of Chinese business abroad to gain strategic leverage.\n\n\"The United States is stepping up containment of China in all respects,\" said Zhu Feng, an international relations expert at Nanjing University. He said targeting Huawei, one of the most successful Chinese companies, \"will trigger anti-U.S. sentiment in China.\"\n\n\"The incident could turn out to be a breaking point,\" Zhu said.\n\nLast month, New Zealand blocked a mobile phone company from using Huawei equipment, saying it posed a \"significant network security risk.\" In August, Australia banned the company from working on the country's fifth-generation network due to security concerns.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported this year that U.S. authorities are investigating whether Huawei violated sanctions on Iran. The Chinese government appealed to Washington to avoid any steps that might damage business confidence.\n\nHuawei's Chinese rival, ZTE Corp., was nearly driven out of business this year when Washington barred it from buying U.S. technology over exports to North Korea and Iran. Trump restored access after ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its executive team and embed a U.S.-chosen compliance team in the company.\n\nHuawei is regarded as far stronger commercially than ZTE. The company based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, has the biggest research and development budget of any Chinese company and a vast portfolio of tech patents, making it less dependent on American suppliers.\n\nIt also has a growing smartphone brand that is one of the top three global suppliers behind Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc. by number of handsets sold.\n\nMeng was changing flights in Canada when she was detained \"on behalf of the United States of America\" to face \"unspecified charges\" in New York, according to a Huawei statement.\n\n\"The company has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng,\" the statement said.\n\nA U.S. Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nHuawei said it complies with all laws and rules where it operates, including export controls and sanctions of the United Nations, the United States and European Union.\n\nMeng is a prominent member of China's business world as deputy chairman of Huawei's board and the daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese military engineer.\n\nDespite that, her arrest is unlikely to derail U.S.-Chinese trade talks, said Willy Lam, a politics specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\n\"I think too much is at stake for Xi Jinping. He desperately wants a settlement,\" said Lam. \"So I don't think this will have a really detrimental impact on the possibility of both countries reaching a deal.\"\n\nLonger term, however, the case will reinforce official Chinese urgency about developing domestic technology suppliers to reduce reliance on the United States, said Lam.\n\nTrump has \"pulled out all the stops\" to hamper Chinese ambitions to challenge the United States as a technology leader, Lam said. That includes imposing limits on visas for Chinese students to study science and technology.\n\n\"If the Chinese need further convincing, this case would show them beyond doubt Trump's commitment,\" said Lam.\n\nDavid Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said U.S. and Canadian business executives could face reprisals in China.\n\n\"That's something we should be watching out for. It's a possibility. China plays rough,\" Mulroney said. \"It's a prominent member of their society and it's a company that really embodies China's quest for global recognition as a technology power.\"\n\nMulroney said Canada should be prepared for \"sustained fury\" from the Chinese and said the arrest will be portrayed in China as Canada kowtowing to Trump. He also said the Iran allegations are very damaging to Huawei and China will push back hard.\n\nThe Chinese will view Meng's arrest on the same day as Trump's meeting with the Chinese leader as a planned conspiracy to do damage, said Wenran Jiang, a senior fellow at the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia.\n\n\"She was in transit though Vancouver. That means the intelligence agencies in Canada and the U.S. were tracking her and planning to arrest her for some time,\" he said.\n\nJiang foresees a crisis in relations between the three countries if Meng is extradited. Any talk of a free trade agreement between Canada and China would be over, he said.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ben Sasser, a Republican member of the Senate Armed Services and Banking committees, said Huawei is an agent of China's ruling Communist Party and applauded Canada for the arrest.\n\n\"Americans are grateful that our Canadian partners have arrested the chief financial officer of a giant Chinese telecom company for breaking U.S. sanctions against Iran,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nGillies reported from Toronto.

                        "docText": "John Key was once very candid in explaining the realpolitik reason New Zealand had to send troops to assist the US war on terror: it was simply \"the price of the club\". He was speaking of the intelligence alliance known as Five Eyes involving the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.\n\nThe Labour-led Government is unlikely to be equally upfront that this week's decision to ban the Chinese company Huawei from supplying the infrastructure for the new telecommunications 5G network is also due to New Zealand's membership of the Western allies' club.\n\nThat reality is clear to political journalist Richard Harman, who says the Huawei ban \"was the only one it could have come to. To have let Huawei in would have placed New Zealand at odds with its traditional friends – Australia, the United States and Britain – and offside with the Five Eyes alliance\" – see: How the Huawei decision saw the old friends prevail.\n\nThis article points out that the Huawei decision \"came coincidentally with the presence in the capital of a top-level delegation from the British Foreign office and also a senior FBI official from the US. The FBI official was here to open a new FBI liaison office in Police Headquarters.\" And although it's not clear that there was any recent pressure on the GCSB to ban Huawei, Harman points out that the signals from Five Eyes partners were very clear on the matter – especially with a British Government report in July, and then in \"August Australia barred Huawei from participating in its 5G network.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is certainly going to be a cost for the ban. First, it seems that there will be consequences in terms of inferior and more expensive communications for consumers. Second, this country's economic and diplomatic ties with the superpower of China will now be strained as a result.\n\nSuch costs could end up being significant, and will affect every New Zealander. In terms of Spark's planned new telecommunications network, Barry Soper explains today: \"they'll probably have to settle for a more expensive and less efficient option. Huawei points out that in a trial for 5G in March they achieved a world record of more than 18 gigabytes a second while their competitors could only manage one gig. With data transfer rates at that speed perhaps that's what spooked the GCSB\" – see: Spy agency's Huawei ban conveniences Government.\n\nAndrew Little pulls the plug on Huawei and Spark's 5G network planned rollout. Cartoon / Rod Emmerson\n\nSoper says that essentially New Zealand has \"finally picked sides\" in the geopolitical rivalry between China and the US. He also stresses the economic and diplomatic prices that New Zealand will have to pay, saying \"This decision has wide-reaching implications for this country with our biggest trading partner\" and the \"renegotiation of our Free Trade Agreement will now be on the back burner\".\n\nIn terms of diplomatic reaction, Soper says: \"Now this is all out in the open it can come as no surprise the Chinese couldn't find the time to see Jacinda Ardern in Beijing before Christmas, she was ready to go at the drop of a hat.\"\n\nLeftwing commentator Gordon Campbell seems to agree, saying \"the Huawei ban is a hostile act\", and the \"indefinite postponing of PM Jacinda Ardern's trip to China is probably the first symptom of the cooling in our relationship\" – see: On how banning Huawei fits into our new hostility towards China.\n\nCampbell also suggests that the Huawei ban on involvement in the 5G project will be costly. He points to the fact that \"In Australia, the Huawei bid was reportedly 30% lower than competing tenders\", and concludes that it \"is reasonable to assume there will be extra costs for consumers as a consequence\".\n\nNew Zealand really had no choice but to ban Huawei according to intelligence expert Paul Buchanan. Photo / File\n\nAs to why the Government is suddenly so sensitive about this new telecommunications network, when they haven't been so worried in the past, Gordon provides a good explanation: \"5G will be the key piece of architecture in the so-called 'Internet of things' that's envisaged to connect our electricity and water systems, medical and driverless technologies, systems in homes and hospitals, factories and farms. The security concerns about China being central to the provision, installation and maintenance of such a massively interlinked system is not hard to imagine\".\n\nCampbell argues that the Huawei ban is part of \"a trifecta of measures via which the 5 Eyes allies have been beefing up their stance towards China\" – the other two components being \"(a) the increased defence spending in Australia and New Zealand for which countering China expansionism is the only conceivable rationale and (b) the massive increase in Australasia's aid and diplomatic profile in the Pacific, in order to counter China's 'cheque book' diplomacy\".\n\nNew Zealand really had no choice but to ban Huawei according to intelligence expert Paul Buchanan: \"Diplomatically, it would be very difficult for the GCSB to green light Huawei's involvement in the 5G upgrade in the face of the US request to withhold approval\" – see: Huawei vs Five Eyes: NZ diplomatic ties at centre of dilemma.\n\nAndrew Hampton, director of GCSB, says he has come under no pressure from Five Eyes counterparts or from political quarters in carrying out his role. Photo / Mark Mitchell\n\nFurthermore, \"The fallout from such a decision could open a rift within the Five Eyes partnership because New Zealand is already seen as the Achilles Heel of the network given its past record of poor cyber security awareness (say, in the overlap between professional and personal communications). It is therefore prudent for the GCSB to side with the US on the matter.\"\n\nSiding with Western allies over China is evidence of New Zealand's shifting orientation towards its biggest trading partner, according to Victoria University of Wellington's strategic studies professor, Robert Ayson – see his Newstalk ZB interview: NZ's relationship with China could suffer after GCSB decision – academic.\n\nOn the Huawei decision, Ayson says: \"I think it's an important sign that New Zealand's approach to China is becoming more cautious. I think the special friendship between New Zealand and China is now a little less special in some ways\".\n\nAyson believes the reasons behind the ban would have been both genuine concerns for national security and about New Zealand's alignment with the Five Eyes countries. He concludes: \"I guess one of the question is, does New Zealand want to be seen as a weaker link?\"\n\nThe cost of the Huawei ban is also well canvassed by Jamie Ensor in his article, NZ could see major fallout from Huawei 5G decision – expert. In this, Richard Harman is quoted on its impact on diplomatic relations with China: \"The frequency of contact between New Zealand and China, and the intimacy of that contact, might slow down for a while\".\n\nIn terms of economic ties, Harman points to tourism and education as being the most likely hit. In terms of \"worst case scenarios\", he says the Chinese Government \"might try and restrain Chinese students who come here for education\" and they might \"take New Zealand off the preferred list of tourist destinations\".\n\nCondemnation of the Huawei ban has been coming from both left and right. The former general secretary of the Labour Party, Mike Smith, has been highly critical of his own government: \"The GCSB ban on Spark's use of Huawei technology means this government has gone from 'honest broker' to poodle in a very short time\" – see: Spooked!.\n\nHe also suggests that it might be time for New Zealand to withdraw from Five Eyes, and says we shouldn't believe much of what is being said about Huawei: \"Maybe it's time we got out of that too – it was designed for war. GCSB Minister Andrew Little argues that the GCSB decision is about the technology not the country. Nobody else believes that, certainly not the lobbyists and commentators including security analyst Adam Boileau, who said that argument didn't make a lot of sense. He says Huawei's engineering is pretty good.\"\n\nRightwing blogger David Farrar appears to be in agreement on much of that, saying \"the reality is that no one anywhere has ever been able to point to an actual security problem with Huawei. It is basically scaremongering\" – see: We join the nonsense ban on Huawei.\n\nFarrar elaborates: \"Basically New Zealand has succumbed to peer pressure from our five eyes partners, primarily the US. Their motivations are protecting US companies from competition. They have never ever been able to say what exactly is it that Huawei has done wrong or could do wrong. They've been banned purely because of the country they are based in. This will increase the costs of telecommunications in New Zealand, by removing a preferred supplier. It will also be seen as a deeply offensive move by the Chinese Government and our exporters will probably end up paying the cost.\"\n\nFinally, for a fictional conversation about how the politics of the Huawei decision might be explained, see Chris Trotter's From a table by the window.",

                        "docText": "COMMENT: By Wu Xi, Chinese Ambassador to New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand, like China, is a firm supporter of open and rules-based global trade.\n\nIt has allowed New Zealand, as a small trading nation, to prosper and punch well above its weight on the world stage. China has benefitted by raising the living standards of millions, modernising our economy and building strong connections with the international community.\n\nDespite the differences between China and New Zealand, the nature of our economies means we both continue to support open and inclusive trade. This is why recent China-US trade frictions and talk of a looming 'trade war' have raised eyebrows here, just as they have in other like-minded trading nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil recently, China and the United States were making considerable progress addressing each other's trade concerns, concluding 11 rounds of trade talks and negotiations. Despite this momentum, the US announced a jump in tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, and threatened to impose additional tariffs on US$300 billion of Chinese goods.\n\nThis isn't the first time the United States has unilaterally chosen to put up trade barriers while talks have been underway. In May and December of 2018, it changed its mind on tariffs overnight, despite a tentative deal having been reached.\n\nWhile all countries remain sovereign, it's the chilling effect on the principles of transparent and open trade that should concern us. This is compounded by US moves to exclude Huawei and other Chinese companies under the guise of 'national security', disrupting market certainty, putting jobs at risk and undermining fair competition.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, right, and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.\n\nThe US does not have a monopoly on the advancement of humanity through the development of science, technology and good ideas. What the actions against Huawei do is threaten global supply chains and further delay the rollout of 5G. This technology has the potential to drive innovation, improve productivity, and enhance the quality of life in many countries, including New Zealand. Seeing this put at risk for the sake of an 'America first' approach is regrettable.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n• 'We're not going to roll over and take this' - Huawei NZ exec\n\n• Huawei ban: China threatens to ban foreign companies\n\nMore broadly, the US is going against the established norm that trade disputes should be solved by negotiations. Their decisions have disrupted the international trading order, triggered strong fluctuations in financial markets, and undermined multilateralism. Simply put, they are inconsistent with the expectations of the international community.\n\nHuawei NZ deputy chief executive Andrew Bowater on his company's decision to sue the US government and its ongoing 5G fight in NZ.\n\nRecently, China has issued a White Paper about our position on the China-US economic and trade consultations. We have made it clear on many occasions that trade problems can't be solved by raising tariffs.\n\nStarting a trade war will be even more harmful; not only to others but also to the country that starts it. As a strong advocate for open trade, China doesn't want a trade war, but if one is brought to our doorstep, we will have no choice but to fight it, to defend and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.\n\nAt the same time, China has chosen to respond with calmness and composure. We believe negotiation, dialogue and consultation are the right ways to resolve differences. Good deals are only made when both parties can benefit, show respect, and are treated equally. This requires effort from both sides.\n\nIn the short term, a trade war started by the US will hurt the Chinese economy, but it will not stop China's long-term development. As President Xi Jinping has pointed out, the Chinese economy is not a pond, but an ocean. After enduring numerous winds and storms, a pond may be irreversibly damaged, but the ocean will still be there.\n\nLanterns at night in the City God Temple of Shanghai.\n\nTake China's GDP for example. In the first quarter of 2019 it grew by 6.4 per cent year on year, which is better than expected. Given the IMF recently downgraded its outlook for global economic growth to 3.3 per cent while upgrading China's growth to 6.3 per cent from 6.2 per cent, China stands out as a good news story among major economies.\n\nThis won't be surprising to people who visit China regularly or know the country well. We have a highly developed industrial base, a growing reputation for scientific and technological innovation, the world's largest middle-income population and a huge market for domestic consumption and investment.\n\nThere is a real sense of energy and optimism in China, and following our own timetable and roadmap, we will continue to implement reforms, open up and pursue high-quality growth for steady and sustained progress.\n\nThis path will benefit not only China, but every country that remains committed to cooperation and open trade as means to develop, grow and prosper. In a world where solving problems takes more partners than ever before, trade protectionism and unilateralism can only be unhelpful.\n\nNew Zealand has been a strong advocate for and supporter of global free trade. One of the greatest illustrations of this was that the first bilateral Free Trade Agreement China signed with developed countries was with New Zealand.\n\n\n\nThis makes New Zealand's position at this moment all the more important in the world.

                        "docText": "This week, WhatsApp began urging its 1.5 billion or so users to update their apps to get the latest security patch. The Facebook-owned company — which touts its \"simple, secure\" messaging — said it discovered spyware had been installed remotely on \"dozens\" of smart phones through the app. The hack affected both Apple and Android users.\n\nWithout naming the company, WhatsApp described the hackers as \"a private company that has been known to work with governments to deliver spyware.\"\n\nThe Financial Times identified the company as NSO Group. A spokesperson for WhatsApp later told The Associated Press: \"We're certainly not refuting any of the [news] coverage you've seen.\"\n\nWhat is NSO Group?\n\nNSO Group describes itself as a cybertechnologies company. Based in Israel, it says it develops technologies that governments and law enforcement agencies can use to track and intercept terror activity, break up organized crime operations, and even search for missing persons.\n\nThe company is backed by Novalpina Capital, a private equity firm based in London.\n\nWhat does its technology do?\n\nNSO is vague about how its technology works. But the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, through its research, has determined that its software basically can gain access to private or confidential information — an individual's smartphone, for example — and through it, see and hear all of its communications.\n\nNSO boasts on its website that its technology \"has helped governments save thousands of lives, prevent terrorist attacks, break up major crimes, and make the world a safer place.\"\n\nBut \"what is concerning, though,\" according to Kevin Mitnick, CEO of mitnicksecurities.com, \"is they sell their cyberweapons to countries that might use it against dissidents and might use it to persecute people that are saying bad things about the country or its leadership.\"\n\nNSO doesn't exactly deny this. It has said that it sells only to responsible countries after diligent vetting, and with Israeli government approval.\n\n\"NSO would not or could not use its technology in its own right to target any person or organization,\" it said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nWhatsApp has said that the vulnerability that allowed the hack to occur involved a missed call coming to the phone through the app. (Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters)\n\nNovalpina Capital said in a statement early Wednesday that NSO's technology \"is designed in such a way that it can only be deployed by an intelligence or law enforcement agency to whom the technology is sold under licence. NSO has no involvement whatsoever in any end-user agency's tactical deployment decisions.\"\n\nThe statement said Novalpina is committed to adhering to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\n\"We abhor any form of misuse of any form of surveillance technology by any government, agency or individual, and we particularly condemn without hesitation any such misuse directed at people who are vulnerable simply as a consequence of their commitment to report on, speak out for or defend human rights,\" said Stephen Peel, founding partner of Novalpina.\n\nWho are NSO's clients?\n\nCitizen Lab says NSO's technologies have been used by some 45 countries, including Mexico, Bahrain, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. The Financial Times, citing an unnamed NSO investor, reports that half of the group's revenues come from the Middle East, but that it has contracts with 21 EU countries, as well.\n\n\"This type of exploit wouldn't be available to the criminal-based type of hackers,\" Mitnick said, \"because they simply can't afford to buy these cyberweapons.\"\n\nPublic Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada did not respond to inquiries about whether Ottawa has bought technology from NSO.\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, says it's not known publicly if Canada has ever been a customer. But he hopes any country considering it would also acquire strong oversight.\n\n\"This technology comes with a temptation to abuse because it's designed to be stealthy and hard to find,\" he said. \"The abuse potential is so dramatic.\"\n\nAmnesty International, which said last year that one of its staffers was targeted by NSO spyware, is demanding Israel suspend NSO's export license for exactly that reason.\n\n\"These softwares that NSO is marketing as tools to prevent terror and crime, are used against human rights defenders and lawyers and doctors and members of Parliament,\" Chen Brill-Egri of Amnesty International Israel told Reuters.\n\n\"And when the Ministry of Defence in Israel allows this to happen, it endangers millions of people around the world.\"\n\nHow did this latest hack happen?\n\nMitnick said many apps are developed with millions of lines of code — and people make mistakes.\n\n\"And what happens is security researchers find these flaws and they're able to develop what they call exploit code to take advantage of these flaws and do exactly what was done in this case.\"\n\nWhatsApp has admitted this vulnerability involved a missed call coming to the phone through the app.\n\n\"No user interaction required,\" said Scott-Railton, \"which makes it particularly insidious.\"\n\nThe hacker would then use that missed call to slide a piece of malware onto the phone.\n\n\"That malware,\" he continued, could then be used \"to turn on the phone's microphone to capture encrypted conversations, private files and personal materials.\"\n\nWas I targeted?\n\nProbably not. WhatsApp says the actual number of people who were affected by this attack amounted to maybe a couple dozen. But as Scott-Railton points out, \"the number of people who are vulnerable to this is quite high … an entire user base.\"\n\nHis takeaway: \"There's a problematic industry that's in the business of finding these vulnerabilities. And instead of disclosing them to companies so that they can be closed up, [they're] selling those vulnerabilities and making them available to customers who will then, as we see, turn around and abuse them.\"\n\nHow do I update my WhatsApp app?\n\nYou can find out here.",

                        "docText": "WhatsApp has launched an unprecedented lawsuit against a cyber weapons firm which it has accused of being behind secret attacks on more than 100 human rights activists, lawyers, journalists, and academics in just two weeks earlier this year.\n\nThe social media giant is suing the NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company, saying it is responsible for a series of highly sophisticated cyber-attacks which it claims violated American law in an “unmistakeable pattern of abuse”.\n\nWhatsApp said it believes the technology sold by NSO was used to target the mobile phones of more than 1,400 of its users in 20 different countries during a 14-day period, spanning the end of April to the middle of May.\n\nIn this brief period, WhatsApp believes those who were the subject of the cyber-attacks included leading human rights defenders and lawyers, prominent religious figures, well-known journalists, and officials in humanitarian organisations.\n\nA number of women previously targeted by cyber-violence, and individuals who have faced assassination attempts and threats of violence, as well as their relatives, were also the victims of the attacks, the company believes.\n\nWhatsApp’s lawsuit, filed in a California court on Tuesday, has demanded a permanent injunction blocking NSO from attempting to access WhatsApp computer systems, and those of its parent company, Facebook.\n\nIt has also asked the court to rule that NSO violated US federal law and California state law against computer fraud, breached their contracts with WhatsApp and “wrongfully trespassed” on Facebook’s property.\n\n“This is the first time that an encrypted messaging provider is taking legal action against a private entity that has carried out this type of attack against its users,” said a WhatsApp spokesman.\n\n“In our complaint we explain how NSO carried out this attack, including acknowledgement from an NSO employee that our steps to remediate the attack were effective.”\n\nThe company is also supporting calls by the UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, David Kaye, for a moratorium on this kind of invasive spyware.\n\n“There must be strong legal oversight of cyber-weapons like the one used in this attack to ensure they are not used to violate individual rights and freedoms people deserve wherever they are in the world,” WhatsApp said.\n\n“Human rights groups have documented a disturbing trend that such tools have been used to attack journalists and human rights defenders.”\n\nWhatsApp said it had worked with Citizen Lab, an academic research group based at the University of Toronto’s Munk School, to identify the victims of the attacks, and the technology used against them. The organisation has begun approaching members of civil society who were affected by the alleged hacks.\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Lab, accused NSO of acting with disregard to the people who were being targeted.\n\n“This is a clear way for WhatsApp to show its users and the public how seriously it is committed to privacy. This is putting a litigation foot forward. It’s not just telling people, we care about your privacy but also trying to hold people accountable,” he said.\n\n\n\n“It is a major positive step forward for human rights protections online and will absolutely set a precedent.\n\n\n\n“While telling the public it is concerned about human rights, the commercial spyware industry has attempted to carve out an unaccountable space for itself, whereby virtue of its proximity to governments, it claims it is acting lawfully, yet prefers to disclaim any responsibility for that behaviour when it suits them.”\n\nWhatsApp’s announcement comes six months after it disclosed it had discovered a vulnerability that allowed cyber-attackers to install surveillance software on to both iPhones and Android phones by ringing targets using the application’s phone. It was unclear at that time how many of WhatsApp’s 1.5bn users were affected.\n\nSince then, WhatsApp, working alongside Citizens Lab, has been attempting to establish how many attacks were launched in the days before the vulnerability was closed. The company is understood to have been shocked at what it found.\n\nIn its lawsuit it has accused NSO of “unlawful access and use of WhatsApp computers, several of which are located in California”.\n\nIt also claims NSO “took a number of steps, using WhatsApp servers and the WhatsApp Service without authorisation, to send discrete malware components (‘malicious code’) to Target Devices” – and that this was done in a way to “conceal defendants’ identity and involvement”.\n\nThe WhatsApp lawsuit is not the only one directed at NSO. The company has been accused of targeting Omar Abdulaziz, who was a close associate of Jamal Khashoggi before the Washington Post journalist was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.\n\nNSO has said it reviews allegations of abuse by clients and that it reserves the right to strip customers of their licences.\n\nThe company was acquired earlier this year by a London-based private equity firm called Novalpina Capital, which in June said it would unveil new governance standards at the company.\n\nNSO has in the past vigorously defended the use of its technology and surveillance software, which is known as Pegasus, as a law enforcement tool that could help prevent crime and terror attacks. Novalpina has credited NSO technology for disrupting plans for a terrorist attack at a crowded stadium in Europe and, citing the Mexican government, said it assisted in the 2011 arrest of the drug kingpin known as El Chapo.\n\nThe Israeli company released details of that new “human rights policy” in November, which it said was founded on “unequivocal respect for human rights”. Among other initiatives, it vowed to integrate new due diligence procedures to identify, prevent, and mitigate “adverse human rights impacts” due to the possible abuse of its technology.\n\nIt also said it would conduct an evaluation of the “potential for adverse human rights impacts” arising through the misuse of NSO products, as well as enforcing “contractual obligations” that would prevent NSO’s customers from using its products for anything other than the investigation of serious crime.\n\nBut the new policy was criticised by some human rights and cyber-surveillance experts, including the UN special rapporteur Kaye.\n\nIn an 18 October letter to Shalev Hulio, one of NSO’s founders, Kaye raised questions about the efficacy of the new human rights guidelines and due diligence procedures, and suggested NSO seemed entirely reliant on its own customers to self-report abuse of its products.\n\nThe Guardian approached NSO for comment about the WhatsApp lawsuit but had not received a reply at the time of publication.\n\n• If you have been affected by or have information on the alleged WhatsApp hack please contact Nick.Hopkins@theguardian.com or Stephanie.Kirchgaessner@theguardian.com\n\n.\n\n\n\n",

                        "docText": "The confirmation by WhatsApp that the mobile phones of several Indian rights activists and journalists had been hacked into has sparked a furore with privacy activists asking the government to clarify. The spyware — Pegasus — sold by Israel’s NSO Group was used to tap into 1,400 WhatsApp accounts globally.Responding to queries from ET, the NSO Group disputed the allegations. “The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists. It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years,” the company said in a statement.On Thursday, IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad took to Twitter to reiterate the Centre’s concern at the breach of privacy of Indians, and said his ministry had sought an explanation from the app. WhatsApp has to reply by November 4. Home ministry officials said ‘attempts to malign the government’ for the reported breach were misleading.“The government operates strictly as per provisions of law and there were adequate provisions to ensure that no innocent citizen was harassed or his privacy breached,” said one of the home ministry officials. They added that the government was committed to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, including the right to privacy, and would take strict action against any intermediary responsible for any breach. A WhatsApp spokesperson confirmed to ET that Indian users were among those contacted this week. Facebook and WhatsApp had filed a lawsuit against the Israeli company in a California court on October 29.Some of the affected Indian activists include lawyer Nihal Singh Rathod, activists Bela Bhatia and Degree Prasad Chauhan, academician Anand Teltumbde and former BBC journalist Shubhranshu Choudhary. They were alerted by WhatsApp earlier this month that their phones had been under surveillance for a two-week period in May 2019. The Indian Express reported the development on Thursday.Rathod, Bhatia, Chauhan and Teltumbde are connected with the Bhima Koregaon case, in which 10 human rights activists were arrested last year on charges of links with a banned Maoist outfit. They claimed they were first contacted by Canadian security research unit The Citizen Lab — which has volunteered to help WhatsApp in the investigations — and later by the messaging app. They were advised to change their phones as well as passwords.Teltumbde said that according to The Citizen Lab, his phone was hacked sometime in March-May. “Pegasus is a sinister software and I noticed my phone was misbehaving. There is rampant spyware hacking in this country. What to do? I don’t know how to live in this country,” he said.Terming the developments as “unprecedented”, privacy experts demanded tighter laws on such surveillance in the country. “It (the government) needs to answer, whether it procured such spyware and why, since under the Telegraph Act or the IT Act there are no powers to install spyware or malware on smartphones,” Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundationtold ET.In a post on October 29, The Citizen Lab — housed in the University of Toronto — said NSO Group’s spyware was being sold to government clients without appropriate controls over how it is used by the clients. “They are, in turn, using NSO’s technology to hack into the devices of members of civil society, including journalists, lawyers, political opposition, and human rights defenders — with potential lethal consequences,” it said.Rathod, who represents several of the accused in the Bhima Koregaon case, including Dalit lawyer Surendra Gadling, told ET that he had suspected his phone was being spied on in 2018 and raised a complaint with WhatsApp in March 2019. Experts contend that surveillance powers in India are not being reconciled with the reality of the Supreme Court’s privacy judgment delivered by a ninejudge bench, and that there is no movement for surveillance reforms either through judicial oversight or parliamentary reporting.“There is a tremendous expansion of the existing surveillance power of the government,” said Gupta of IFF, which has challenged in the Supreme Court the December 2018 notification of the home ministry authorising 10 central agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt any computer information.Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director and senior international counsel at Access Now, said hacking is a criminal offence under the IT Act. “Last week, the Bombay High Court passed a judgment against the CBI in a corruption case over illegally intercepted conversations and said it is against the Supreme Court order on privacy. The HC said this can be allowed only in the case of public emergency or in the interest of public safety,” he said.Access Now is an international non-profit, human rights, public policy and advocacy group that works towards an open and free internet.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco, messaging service WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook Inc, accused NSO of facilitating government hacking sprees in 20 countries. Mexico, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were the only countries identified.\n\nWhatsApp said in a statement that 100 civil society members had been targeted, and called it “an unmistakable pattern of abuse.”\n\nNSO denied the allegations.\n\n“In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today’s allegations and will vigorously fight them,” NSO said in a statement. “The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.”\n\nWhatsApp said the attack exploited its video calling system in order to send malware to the mobile devices of a number of users. The malware would allow NSO’s clients - said to be governments and intelligence organizations - to secretly spy on a phone’s owner, opening their digital lives up to official scrutiny.\n\nWhatsApp is used by some 1.5 billion people monthly and has often touted a high level of security, including end-to-end encrypted messages that cannot be deciphered by WhatsApp or other third parties.\n\nCitizen Lab, a cybersecurity research laboratory based at the University of Toronto that worked with WhatsApp to investigate the phone hacking, told Reuters that the targets included well-known television personalities, prominent women who had been subjected to online hate campaigns and people who had faced “assassination attempts and threats of violence.”\n\nNeither Citizen Lab nor WhatsApp identified the targets by name.\n\nGovernments have increasingly turned to sophisticated hacking software as officials seek to push their surveillance power into the furthest corners of their citizens’ digital lives.\n\nCompanies like NSO say their technology enables officials to circumvent the encryption that increasingly protects the data held on phones and other devices. But governments only rarely talk about their capabilities publicly, meaning that the digital intrusions like the ones that affected WhatsApp typically happen in the shadows.\n\nWhatsApp’s said its legal move was unprecedented, saying it was “the first time that an encrypted messaging provider is taking legal action against a private entity that has carried out this type of attack against its users.”\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to have NSO barred from accessing or attempting to access WhatsApp and Facebook’s services and seeks unspecified damages.\n\nNSO’s phone hacking software has already been implicated in a series of human rights abuses across Latin America and the Middle East, including a sprawling espionage scandal in Panama and an attempt to spy on an employee of the London-based rights group Amnesty International.\n\nNSO came under particularly harsh scrutiny over the allegation that its spyware played a role in the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul a little over a year ago.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is displayed in front of binary digits in this illustration taken, March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nKhashoggi’s friend Omar Abdulaziz is one of seven activists and journalists who have taken the spyware firm to court in Israel and Cyprus over allegations that their phones were compromised using NSO technology. Amnesty has also filed a lawsuit, demanding that the Israeli Ministry of Defense revoke NSO’s export license to “stop it profiting from state-sponsored repression.”\n\nNSO has recently tried to clean up its image after it was bought by London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital earlier this year. In August, NSO co-founder Shalev Hulio appeared on “60 Minutes” and boasted his spyware had saved “tens of thousands of people.” He provided no details.\n\nNSO has also brought on a series of high-profile advisers, including former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge and Juliette Kayyem, a senior lecturer in international security at Harvard University. Last month, NSO announced it would begin abiding by U.N. guidelines on human rights abuses.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International, which has asked Israel’s government to revoke NSO’s export license, was sceptical that NSO’s new policies would make a difference.\n\nNSO is best known as a supplier of surveillance tools to governments and law enforcers, and says its products tackle and prevent serious crimes and support search and rescue operations after natural disasters.\n\nBut its cellphone hacking software, Pegasus, has been linked to political surveillance in Mexico, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, according to University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which researches digital surveillance, security, privacy and accountability.\n\nShalev Hulio, co-founder and chief executive of NSO, said: “NSO’s products provide governments with the tools to help stop the world’s worst terror attacks and most dangerous criminals. But (we) also understand that misuse could represent human rights violations.”\n\nNSO said it would from now on systematically apply U.N. procedures set in 2011 to identify risks that its technology could harm human rights, and then prevent or mitigate them.\n\nIt also plans to evaluate its sales process and contractually oblige customers to limit the use of its products to the prevention and investigation of serious crimes, and to ensure that they will not be used to violate human rights.\n\nNSO needs to turn words into action, Danna Ingleton, deputy director of Amnesty Tech, the technology and human rights division of Amnesty, told Reuters.\n\n“NSO is a company that has a history of saying one thing and doing another,” she said. “The reason why they are doing this is to whitewash violations.”\n\nSECURITY BREACH\n\nShe said that NSO and the industry as a whole needs more accountability and to do more due diligence when selling to oppressive regimes so human rights defenders are not targeted.\n\nA Saudi dissident close to murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi filed a lawsuit last year alleging that NSO had helped the royal court to take over his smartphone and spy on his communications with Khashoggi. Hulio has denied that NSO technology was used in Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nIn May, the electronic encrypted messaging service WhatsApp said a security breach on its app showed signs of coming from a government using surveillance technology developed by a private company, and may have targeted human rights groups.\n\nWhatsApp told rights groups it had some reasons to believe the spyware had been developed by NSO. The firm at the time did not comment on the incidents but said it would investigate any “credible allegations of misuse” of its systems.\n\nNSO, which Francisco Partners sold seven months ago to NSO managers and the European private equity firm Novalpina Capital, said the rules also provide mechanisms to enable reporting and investigation of suspected misuse of its products.\n\n“This new policy publicly affirms our unequivocal respect for human rights and our commitment to mitigate the risk of misuse,” Hulio said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nA source close to NSO said the company remains steadfast in its belief that it does not know how its products are used by governments, while the firm strives to find a balance between helping governments save lives and potential abuses.\n\nThe source said NSO rejected contracts of some $250 million in the last few years following internal review processes due to possible misuse of its technologies.\n\nNSO said it had taken on Tom Ridge and Juliette Kayyem, former secretary and assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and former French ambassador to the United States Gerard Araud as advisers.",

Ashwiniji has already given a reply in Parliament and there is nothing else to say on this topic.”\n\nIn a tweet, Mr. Cathcart said, “This is a wake up call for security on the Internet. The mobile phone is the primary computer for billions of people. Governments and companies must do everything they can to make it as secure as possible. Our security and freedom depend on it.”\n\nAlso read: No illegal surveillance possible in India: IT Minister\n\nWhatsApp had in 2019 sued the NSO Group, accusing it of using the former’s messaging service to conduct cyber-espionage on roughly 1,400 user accounts, including those of journalists and human rights activists.\n\nMr. Cathcart added that there is a need for more companies, and, critically, governments, to take steps to hold NSO Group accountable. “Once again, we urge a global moratorium on the use of unaccountable surveillance technology now. It’s past time,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in a jibe aimed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, tweeted, “We know what he’s been reading — everything on your phone! #Pegasus”.\n\nExplained | Pegasus, the spyware that came in via WhatsApp\n\nIn a statement, the CPI (M) said the Central government must answer and come clean on using the Pegasus cyber software for surveillance of Indian citizens in an illegal and unauthorised manner. It further pointed out that two years ago, the party had raised concerns in Parliament that this spyware was being used in India as revealed by WhatsApp. The Modi government’s response had not categorically denied that it engaged the services of NSO but claimed that there is no “unauthorized surveillance,” the party said.\n\n“Use of a cyber spy software to hack smartphones even by the government is prohibited under Indian laws. Under what law has the government undertaken such surveillance activities over citizens? The right to privacy is a fundamental right as laid down by the Supreme Court, but this BJP government is prevaricating on legislating the privacy law,” the CPI (M) added.\n\nLikewise, CPI general secretary D. Raja said, “It seems this government is very close to the Israeli administration. The revelations are extremely shocking. The Prime Minister needs to clarify and concede that the government does not believe in the privacy of its citizens.”\n\nReacting to the surveillance revelations, the India-based not-for-profit Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) said there is a need for urgent surveillance reform to protect citizens against the use of such invasive technologies which hamper their fundamental right to privacy and threaten the democratic ideals of India.\n\n“Use of such surveillance technology on journalists leads to a chilling effect as it precludes them from working and reporting on sensitive matters, some of which may also be against the ruling government, without jeopardising themselves and the personal safety of their sources,” the IFF said. It added that such snooping also stops human rights defenders from working with vulnerable people, some of whom may have been victimised by their own government, without opening them up to further abuse.\n\nThe Foundation also called upon the Narendra Modi-led government to stand by its democratic commitments and reject the use of spyware in their pursuit of social objectives of policing and security.\n\n“Legislative measures must be introduced in Parliament to uphold the Right to Privacy decision of the Supreme Court of India recognising privacy as a fundamental right. The use of legal or technical means to access data and intercept communications in India must be authorised only in emergency situations, under judicial control and oversight, and with other protections to safeguard our citizens,” it said.\n\nEdward Snowden, the whistleblower behind surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), said the NSO Group should bear direct, criminal liability for the deaths and detentions of those targeted by the digital infection vectors it sells, which have no legitimate use.\n\nThe NSO, however, has said that it sells its technologies solely to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments for the sole purpose of saving lives through preventing crime and terror acts. NSO does not operate the system and has no visibility to the data, the group said. “NSO products are used exclusively by government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to fight crime and terror,” as per the company’s website.\n\nCongress leader Manish Tiwari pointed out that to check unauthorised surveillance by intelligence agencies, he had moved a Bill in 2011 — Intelligence Services (Powers and Regulation) Bill 2011, and has listed it for introduction again.",

REUTERS/Amir Cohen\n\nNov 8 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court said Facebook can pursue a lawsuit accusing Israel's NSO Group of exploiting a bug in its WhatsApp messaging app to install malware allowing the surveillance of 1,400 people, including journalists, human rights activists and dissidents.\n\nIn a 3-0 decision on Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco rejected privately owned NSO's claim it was immune from being sued because it had acted as a foreign government agent.\n\nFacebook, now known as Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), sued NSO for an injunction and damages in October 2019, accusing it of accessing WhatsApp servers without permission six months earlier to install its Pegasus malware on victims' mobile devices.\n\nNSO has argued that Pegasus helps law enforcement and intelligence agencies fight crime and protect national security.\n\nIt was appealing a trial judge's July 2020 refusal to award it \"conduct-based immunity,\" a common law doctrine protecting foreign officials acting in their official capacity.\n\nUpholding that ruling, Circuit Judge Danielle Forrest said it was an \"easy case\" because NSO's mere licensing of Pegasus and offering technical support did not shield it from liability under federal law, which took precedence over common law.\n\n\"Whatever NSO's government customers do with its technology and services does not render NSO an 'agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,'\" Forrest wrote. \"Thus, NSO is not entitled to the protection of foreign sovereign immunity.\"\n\nThe case will return to U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California.\n\nAsked for comment on the decision, NSO said in an email that its technology helps defend the public against serious crime and terrorism, and that it \"stands undeterred in its mission.\"\n\nWhatsApp spokesman Joshua Breckman in an email called the decision \"an important step in holding NSO accountable for its attacks against journalists, human rights defenders and government leaders.\"\n\nFacebook's case drew support from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Cisco Systems Corp (CSCO.O), which in a court filing called surveillance technology such as Pegasus \"powerful, and dangerous.\"\n\nOn Nov. 3, the U.S. government blacklisted NSO and Israel's Candiru for allegedly providing spyware to governments that used it to \"maliciously target\" journalists, activists and others.\n\nThe case is WhatsApp Inc et al v NSO Group Technologies Ltd et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-16408.\n\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Elizabeth Culliford; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

In the case of journalists, that lets hackers spy on reporters’ communications with sources.\n\nAn investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military-grade malware from Israel-based NSO Group, the world’s most infamous hacker-for-hire outfit, is being used to spy on journalists, human rights activists and political dissidents.\n\nFrom a list of more than 50,000 cellphone numbers obtained by the Paris-based journalism non-profit Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International and shared with 16 news organizations, journalists were able to identify more than 1,000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by NSO clients for potential surveillance.\n\nThey include 189 journalists, more than 600 politicians and government officials, at least 65 business executives, 85 human rights activists and several heads of state, according to The Washington Post, a consortium member. The journalists work for organizations including The Associated Press, Reuters, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, Le Monde and The Financial Times.\n\nAmnesty also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that NSO Group’s flagship Pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, just four days after he was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The company had previously been implicated in other spying activities on Khashoggi.\n\nNSO Group denied in an emailed response to AP questions that it has ever maintained “a list of potential, past or existing targets.” In a separate statement, it called the Forbidden Stories report “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories.”\n\nThe company reiterated its claims that it only sells to “vetted government agencies” for use against terrorists and major criminals and that it has no visibility into its customers’ data. Critics call those claims dishonest — and have provided evidence that NSO directly manages the high-tech spying. They say the repeated abuse of Pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry.\n\nThe source of the leak — and how it was authenticated -- was not disclosed. While a phone number’s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device, the consortium said it believed the data indicated potential targets of NSO’s government clients. The Post said it identified 37 hacked smartphones on the list. The Guardian, another consortium member, reported that Amnesty had found traces of Pegasus infections on the cellphones of 15 journalists who let their phones be examined after discovering their number was in the leaked data.\n\nThe most numbers on the list, 15,000, were for Mexican phones, with a large share in the Middle East. NSO Group’s spyware has been implicated in targeted surveillance chiefly in the Middle East and Mexico. Saudi Arabia is reported to be among NSO clients. Also on the lists were phones in countries including France, Hungary, India, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Pakistan.\n\nAlso Read New online platform maps Pegasus spread\n\n“The number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how Pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media. It is about controlling public narrative, resisting scrutiny, and suppressing any dissenting voice,” Amnesty quoted its secretary-general, Agnes Callamard, as saying.\n\nIn one case highlighted by the Guardian, Mexican reporter Cecilio Pineda Birto was assassinated in 2017 a few weeks after his cell phone number appeared on the leaked list.\n\nAP’s director of media relations, Lauren Easton, said the company is “deeply troubled to learn that two AP journalists, along with journalists from many news organizations” are on the list of the 1,000 potential targets for Pegasus infection. She said the AP was investigating to try to determine if its two staffers’ devices were compromised by the spyware.\n\nThe consortium’s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers, primarily from the University of Toronto-based watchdog Citizen Lab. NSO targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of Al-Jazeera journalists and executives, New York Times Beirut bureau chief Ben Hubbard, Moroccan journalist and activist Omar Radi and prominent Mexican anti-corruption reporter Carmen Aristegui. Her phone number was on the list, the Post reported. The Times said Hubbard and its former Mexico City bureau chief, Azam Ahmed, were on the list.\n\nTwo Hungarian investigative journalists, Andras Szabo and Szabolcs Panyi, were among journalists on the list whose phones were successfully infected with Pegasus, the Guardian reported.\n\nAmong more than two dozen previously documented Mexican targets are proponents of a soda tax, opposition politicians, human rights activists investigating a mass disappearance and the widow of a slain journalist. In the Middle East, the victims have mostly been journalists and dissidents, allegedly targeted by the Saudi and United Arab Emirates governments.\n\nThe consortium’s “Pegasus Project” reporting bolsters accusations that not just autocratic regimes but democratic governments, including India and Mexico, have used NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware for political ends. Its members, who include Le Monde and Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Germany, are promising a series of stories based on the leak.\n\nPegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone’s microphones and cameras. In the case of journalists, that lets hackers spy on reporters’ communications with sources.\n\nThe program is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity. NSO Group’s methods to infect its victims have grown so sophisticated that researchers say it can now do so without any user interaction, the so-called “zero-click” option.\n\nIn 2019, WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook sued NSO Group in U.S. federal court in San Francisco, accusing it of exploiting a flaw in the popular encrypted messaging service to target — with missed calls alone — some 1,400 users. NSO Group denies the accusations.\n\nThe Israeli company was sued the previous year in Israel and Cyprus, both countries from which it exports products. The plaintiffs include Al-Jazeera journalists, as well as other Qatari, Mexican and Saudi journalists and activists who say the company’s spyware was used to hack them.\n\nSeveral of the suits draw heavily on leaked material provided to Abdullah Al-Athbah, editor of the Qatari newspaper Al-Arab and one of the alleged victims. The material appears to show officials in the United Arab Emirates discussing whether to hack into the phones of senior figures in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, including members of the Qatari royal family.\n\nNSO Group does not disclose its clients and says it sells its technology to Israeli-approved governments to help them target terrorists and break up pedophile rings and sex- and drug-trafficking rings. It claims its software has helped save thousands of lives and denies its technology was in any way associated with Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nNSO Group also denies involvement in elaborate undercover operations uncovered by The AP in 2019 in which shadowy operatives targeted NSO critics including a Citizen Lab researcher to try to discredit them.\n\nLast year, an Israeli court dismissed an Amnesty International lawsuit seeking to strip NSO of its export license, citing insufficient evidence.\n\nNSO Group is far from the only merchant of commercial spyware. But its behavior has drawn the most attention, and critics say that is with good reason.\n\nLast month, it published its first transparency report, in which it says it has rejected “more than $300 million in sales opportunities as a result of its human rights review processes.” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a strident critic, tweeted: “If this report was printed, it would not be worth the paper it was printed on.”\n\nA new, interactive online data platform created by the group Forensic Architecture with support from Citizen Lab and Amnesty International catalogs NSO Group’s activities by country and target. The group partnered with filmmaker Laura Poitras, best known for her 2014 documentary “Citzenfour” about NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who offers video narrations.\n\n“Stop what you’re doing and read this,” Snowden tweeted Sunday, referencing the consortium’s findings. “This leak is going to be the story of the year.”\n\nSince 2019, the U.K. private equity firm Novalpina Capital has controlled a majority stake in NSO Group. Earlier this year, Israeli media reported the company was considering an initial public offering, most likely on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.",

The data also contains the time and date that numbers were selected, or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared access with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the project, did the forensic analyses. What does the leak indicate? The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent, the presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the phone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company’s signature surveillance tool, or whether any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and US numbers, which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools, reveals some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with Pegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the start of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds. What did forensic analysis reveal? Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30, the tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced. Fifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful infection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of targeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages. Amnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic methods, and found them to be sound. Which NSO clients were selecting numbers? While the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its tools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO. What does NSO Group say? You can read NSO Group’s full statement here. The company has always said it does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s technology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to believe the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. After further questions, the lawyers said the consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group technologies”. What is HLR lookup data? The term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and their general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to Pegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.

While the investigation mostly points to Khashoggi’s close associates being targeted in the months after the murder, it also identified evidence suggesting that an NSO client targeted the phone of his wife, Hanan Elatr, several months before his death, between November 2017 and April 2018.\n\nThe client appears to have used NSO’s spyware, Pegasus, which can transform a phone into a surveillance device, with microphones and cameras activated without a user knowing.\n\nA forensic examination of Elatr’s Android phone found that she was sent four text messages that contained malicious links connected to Pegasus. The analysis indicated the targeting came from the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally. However, the examination did not confirm whether the device had been successfully infected.\n\n“Jamal warned me before that this might happen,” Elatr said. “It makes me believe they are aware of everything that happened to Jamal through me.” She added that she was concerned his conversations with fellow dissidents might have been monitored through her phone. “I kept my phone on the tea table [in their Virginia home] while Jamal was talking to a Saudi guy twice a week.”\n\nElatr’s number was also contained in a leak of numbers that were selected by clients of NSO as candidates for possible surveillance. Access to the leak was shared with the Guardian and other media by Forbidden Stories, a nonprofit organisation, as part of a collaborative investigation called the Pegasus project. Examination of phones was done by Amnesty International’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the Pegasus project.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have already concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was responsible for ordering the murder of Khashoggi, a former Saudi government insider whose criticism of the kingdom’s regime in the pages of the Washington Post was seen as a threat to the Saudi heir.\n\nA team of Saudi agents killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul during his visit there to pick up documents he needed to get married to his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, who later became an outspoken advocate for accountability over his murder.\n\nJamal Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nForensic analysis revealed that Cengiz’s phone was first infected with Pegasus just four days after his murder, on 6 October 2018. Her phone was also hacked on two other days in October 2018. Further attempts to hack her phone followed in June 2019, although they did not appear to be successful. Data analysis suggested that Saudi Arabia was behind her hacking. Cengiz said she was not surprised she had been hacked: “I was thinking this after the murder. But what can you do?”\n\nA close friend of Khashoggi, Wadah Khanfar, the former director general of the Al Jazeera television network, was also hacked using Pegasus, with analysis showing that his phone was infected as recently July 2021.\n\nThe phone analysis discoveries and leaked phone records suggest that Saudi Arabia and its allies used NSO’s spyware in the aftermath of the murder to monitor the campaign for justice led by friends and associates of Khashoggi, while also showing an intent to spy on the official Turkish inquiry into his murder.\n\nKhashoggi associates who were targeted for possible surveillance after his death, according to the leak, include Abdullah Khashoggi, the journalist’s son; Azzam Tamimi, a Palestinian-British activist and friend, and Madawi Al-Rasheed, a London-based scholar who co-created an opposition party of expatriate Saudis in the wake of the murder.\n\nThe Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who US intelligence agencies have concluded was responsible for ordering the murder of Khashoggi. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nAnalysis of Rasheed’s phone found evidence of an attempted hack in April 2019, but there was no evidence the spyware was successfully installed.\n\nOther Khashoggi-connected names linked to in the data were Yahya Assiri, a UK-based Saudi activist who documents human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and was in close contact with Khashoggi before his death, and Yasin Aktay, a friend of Khashoggi and a top aide to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. No forensics were able to be carried out on their phones.\n\nQ&A What is the Pegasus project? Show The Pegasus project is a collaborative journalistic investigation into the NSO Group and its clients. The company sells surveillance technology to governments worldwide. Its flagship product is Pegasus, spying software – or spyware – that targets iPhones and Android devices. Once a phone is infected, a Pegasus operator can secretly extract chats, photos, emails and location data, or activate microphones and cameras without a user knowing. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty International had access to a leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers selected as targets by clients of NSO since 2016. Access to the data was then shared with the Guardian and 16 other news organisations, including the Washington Post, Le Monde, Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung. More than 80 journalists have worked collaboratively over several months on the investigation, which was coordinated by Forbidden Stories. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIn an interview, Aktay said he had already been alerted by Turkish intelligence officials that his phone had been hacked after Khashoggi’s death because the Saudis were still trying to create a “map” of the journalist’s connections. “It was needless,” Aktay said of the surveillance. “I was just a friend of his.”\n\nİrfan Fidan, the Turkish prosecutor who charged 20 Saudis over the Khashoggi killing. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe phone number of İrfan Fidan, the Istanbul chief prosecutor who later formally charged 20 Saudi nationals over the killing, also appeared in the list of numbers of possible candidates for surveillance by NSO Group clients.\n\nWithout forensic examination of their phones, it is not possible to know whether these targets were infiltrated or successfully hacked using Pegasus.\n\nIn a statement, NSO said: “Our technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi. We can confirm that our technology was not used to listen, monitor, track, or collect information regarding him or his family members mentioned in your inquiry.”\n\nAgnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, which is a partner in the Pegasus project, said new discoveries about Khashoggi-related targets indicated an attempt by Saudi Arabia and others to gather intelligence on the fallout from the killing.\n\n“The targeting indicates a clear intention to know what the prosecutor and a few other high political actors were doing,” she said. “They saw Turkey as the heart of what they needed to control.”",

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nThe data suggests that Jendoubi was selected as a potential surveillance target by Saudi Arabia, which was a longtime client of NSO before it was dropped earlier this year after allegations that it abused the surveillance tool.\n\nIn a statement in response to questions about Jendoubi’s case, an NSO spokesperson said: “Based on the details you have provided us we can confirm that Kamel Jendoubi was not targeted by any of our current customers”.\n\nJendoubi, a human rights defender and opponent of former president Ben Ali’s regime in Tunisia, was appointed by the Office of the UN high commissioner for Human Rights to lead a group of international experts to investigate human rights violations in 2017.\n\nThe UN mandate to investigate the possible war crimes came to an abrupt halt this October, after the members of the Human Rights Council voted to end the investigation.\n\nCiting political and diplomatic experts with close knowledge of the matter, the Guardian reported earlier this month that Saudi Arabia used “incentives and threats” as part of a lobbying campaign to shut down the UN investigation.\n\nJendoubi told the Pegasus Project that the targeting of his phone marked the actions of a “rogue state”.\n\n“There are no other words. As international investigators, we are supposed to be at least protected. But I am not at all surprised. I’ve been apprehensive about this since 2019,” he said.\n\n“We knew that we [the panel] could be potentially targeted since the publication of our 2018 report. That report had created a shock in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. They did not expect such findings.”\n\n\n\nJendoubi added: “They used all their propaganda, their media … to defame us and discredit our work. Everything you would expect from them. Until the 2021 vote that ended our mission.”\n\nThe investigator said he did not believe that his work had been compromised on the targeted phone because he had used another device to conduct his investigations. He said the targeting of his phone was indicative of a state that did not care about “commitments and minimum international rules”.\n\nMelissa Parke, an expert investigator on the GEE and former Australian MP, said in response to the news of Jendoubi’s targeting: “If only this extraordinary technology and energy could be applied for the benefit of the people of Yemen, instead of the reverse. The calls for accountability for crimes committed in Yemen will only increase in the wake of these revelations.”\n\nThe Pegasus Project approached Jendoubi after it was confirmed that his mobile number was listed in the leaked database.\n\nExperts at Amnesty International’s Security Lab and Citizen Lab, who research sophisticated digital surveillance attacks, found traces of Pegasus on Jendoubi’s mobile phone, which also correlated to a timestamp in the database that indicated when the number was selected.\n\nThe experts said the forensic analysis showed that a client of NSO had attempted to hack the device.\n\nThere was no clear evidence that the mobile had successfully been hacked or data exfiltrated, however, because that data could not be retrieved.\n\nIf a phone is infected with NSO’s signature spyware, called Pegasus, operators of the spyware have total access, including the ability to intercept phone calls, read text messages, infiltrate encrypted apps and track an individual’s physical location. The spyware can also turn a mobile into a listening device by remotely controlling the mobile’s recorder.\n\nNSO has staunchly denied that the leaked database at the heart of the Pegasus Project is in any way connected to the company or its clients. NSO has also said that its government clients are only meant to use its surveillance tools to fight serious crime and terrorism and that it investigates credible allegations of misuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe revelation that Jendoubi’s phone was targeted drew a tepid response from the office of UN secretary general António Guterres. A UN spokesperson said Jendoubi was an independent expert and that the UN would leave it to him to comment more specifically on his own situation.\n\n“More generally, regarding Pegasus, the UN has been in touch with relevant parties to ensure that our communications are protected. We take very seriously the need to uphold the security of all our communications and have been following up on all reports of potential hacking,” said Farhan Aziz Haq.\n\nRupert Colville, spokesperson for Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said: “The targeting of human rights defenders, journalists and politicians is just another example of how tools allegedly meant to address security risks can end up being weaponised against people with dissenting opinions.”\n\nAgnes Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, who previously served as a UN special rapporteur, called the news of Jendoubi’s alleged targeting “shocking and unacceptable”.\n\n“That he was targeted in the course of inquiry into violations by all parties to an armed conflict and at the hands of a lead party to that conflict? That alleged conduct demonstrates far more than cynicism and callous disregard for the principle of accountability, although it certainly does that,” Callamard said.\n\n“It suggests further reprehensible evidence of the Saudi authorities’ utter disregard for international law, their willingness to do anything to maintain their impunity, and it demonstrates yet again a complete disrespect for the United Nations, multilateral instruments and human rights procedures.”",

Three Android phones showed signs of targeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages. Amnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic methods, and found them to be sound. Which NSO clients were selecting numbers? While the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its tools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO. What does NSO Group say? You can read NSO Group’s full statement here. The company has always said it does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s technology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to believe the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. After further questions, the lawyers said the consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group technologies”. What is HLR lookup data? The term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and their general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to Pegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.

An attack on a journalist could expose a reporter’s confidential sources as well as allowing NSO’s government client to read their chat messages, harvest their address book, listen to their calls, track their precise movements and even record their conversations by activating the device’s microphone.\n\nReporters whose numbers appear in the data range from local freelancers, such as the Mexican journalist Cecilio Pineda Birto, who was murdered by attackers armed with guns one month after his phone was selected, through to prize-winning investigative reporters, editors and executives at leading media organisations.\n\nIn addition to the UAE, detailed analysis of the data indicates that the governments of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda and Saudi Arabia all selected journalists as possible surveillance targets.\n\nIt is not possible to know conclusively whether phones were successfully infected with Pegasus without analysis of devices by forensic experts. Amnesty International’s Security Lab, which can detect successful Pegasus infections, found traces of the spyware on the mobile phones of 15 journalists who had agreed to have their phones examined after discovering their number was in the leaked data.\n\nLeft: Siddharth Varadarajan, co-founder of the Indian news website the Wire. Right: Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, a reporter at the Wire. Composite: thewire.in/c/o Paranjoy Guha Thakurta\n\nAmong the journalists confirmed by analysis to have been hacked by Pegasus were Siddharth Varadarajan and Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, a co-founder and a reporter at the Indian news website the Wire. Thakurta was hacked in 2018 while he was working on an investigation into how the Hindu nationalist government of Narendra Modi was using Facebook to systematically spread disinformation among Indian people online.\n\n“You feel violated,” Varadarajan said of the hacking of his device and the selection of his colleagues for targeting. “This is an incredible intrusion and journalists should not have to deal with this. Nobody should have to deal with this, but in particular journalists and those who are in some way working for the public interest.”\n\nOmar Radi, a Moroccan freelance journalist and human rights activist who has published repeated exposés of government corruption, was hacked by an NSO client believed to be the government of Morocco throughout 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe Moroccan government has since accused him of being a British spy, in allegations described by Human Rights Watch as “abusing the justice system to silence one of the few remaining critical voices in Moroccan media”.\n\nSaad Bendourou, a deputy head of mission at the Moroccan embassy in France, dismissed the consortium’s findings.\n\n“We remind you that the unfounded allegations already published by Amnesty International and relayed by Forbidden Stories have already been the subject of an official response by the Moroccan authorities, who categorically denied such allegations,” he said.\n\nKhadija Ismayilova: ‘It’s despicable, it’s heinous’\n\nIsmayilova faced a sustained campaign of harassment and intimidation. Photograph: Aziz Karimov/AP Composite: AP\n\nKhadija Ismayilova, an award-winning Azerbaijani investigative journalist, was also confirmed by technical analysis to have been hacked with Pegasus in 2019. She has spent years reporting on the network of corruption and self-enrichment that surrounds the autocratic president, Ilham Aliyev, who has ruled his country since seizing power in 2003.\n\nShe has faced a sustained campaign of harassment and intimidation in retaliation for her work. In 2012 intimate videos of her, filmed using a camera installed in her apartment without her knowledge, were published online shortly after she received a letter warning her to “behave or be defamed”.\n\nIn 2014 she was arrested on charges of alleged tax evasion, “illegal business” offences, and the “incitement to suicide” of a still-living colleague. She was released from a jail sentence of seven and a half years following an appeal, though remained subject to a travel ban as well as an asset freeze preventing her from accessing her own bank account until recently.\n\nHer phone was almost certainly hacked by agents of the Aliyev regime, according to analysis of the leaked data. The same NSO customer also selected as surveillance candidates more than 1,000 other Azerbaijani phones, many belonging to Azerbaijani dissidents, as well two of Ismayilova’s lawyers.\n\n“I feel guilty for the sources who sent me [information], thinking that some encrypted messaging ways are secure. They did it and they didn’t know my phone was infected,” Ismayilova said.\n\n“My family members are also victimised, people I’ve been working with. People who told me their private secrets are victimised. It’s not just me.”\n\nShe added: “I’m angry with the government who produce all of these tools and sell them to the bad guys like the Aliyev regime. It’s despicable, it’s heinous … When the video was exposed, it was just me. Now I don’t know who else has been exposed because of me, who else is in danger because of me.”\n\nBradley Hope: ‘Your phone is a potential surveillance device’\n\nInvestigative journalist Bradley Hope. Composite: David Levene/Guardian\n\nAlso listed in the leaked records is a UK phone number belonging to the American investigative journalist Bradley Hope, who lives in London. At the time of his selection he was an employee at the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn spring 2018 Hope and his colleague Tom Wright were fact-checking a draft of a book on 1MDB, a corruption scandal involving the theft of $4.5bn from the state of Malaysia. Central to the allegations were Najib Razak, the country’s prime minister, and a businessman named Jho Low.\n\nPart of their investigation also concerned the possibility that some of the money had been spent on a luxury yacht, called the Topaz, for Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister of the UAE and a senior member of the Abu Dhabi royal family.\n\nAs part of standard journalistic practice, Hope and Wright contacted parties who would be named in their book and offered them an opportunity to comment.\n\nThe records reveal that around the same time, one of NSO’s government clients – believed to be the UAE – began selecting Hope’s mobile phone as a possible surveillance candidate.\n\nHis number was included on the list until at least the spring of 2019, during which time Hope and Wright continued to report on new disclosures in the 1MDB corruption investigation. Wright’s phone number does not appear in the list.\n\nHope no longer has access to his phone so the Guardian was unable to carry out an analysis, although checks on his current device found no suggestion he was currently being monitored.\n\n“I think probably the number one thing that anyone targeting my phone would want to know is: who are my sources?” Hope said. “They would want to know who it is that is providing this insight.”\n\nHe suggested that one possibility was that the country might have been interested in him because it was trying to calculate where, if anywhere, he stood in relation to the vast and sprawling regional rivalry between the UAE and its neighbour Qatar.\n\nHope said he had already adopted various digital security countermeasures, including regularly replacing his phone handset, updating operating systems and not bringing electronic devices into high-risk jurisdictions such as the UAE.\n\n“Knowing that a country can so easily penetrate your phone, it inevitably means that you have to always be thinking about your phone as a potential surveillance device,” he said. “It will just remind me that at any time I could be carrying around a vulnerability with me.”\n\nOther prominent journalists whose phones were selected by NSO’s clients include Gregg Carlstrom, a Middle East reporter at the Economist, whose Egyptian and Qatari phone numbers were selected as possible targets by an NSO client, believed to the UAE.\n\nProminent media executives, including Edwy Plenel, the founder of the French online investigative outlet Mediapart, were also selected.\n\n‘There are not enough safeguards’\n\nCarlos Martínez de la Serna, a programme director at the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists, said the use of spyware to attack journalists and their sources was becoming an increasingly serious issue for his organisation.\n\n“Putting surveillance on a journalist has a very strong, chilling effect. Our devices are key in the reporting activity, and it exposes the journalist’s contacts, it exposes the journalist’s sources, exposes the journalist’s materials,” he said. “It targets the journalistic activity in a way that almost fully impedes it in situations where journalists are being threatened.”\n\nMartínez said there was an urgent need for countries to begin regulating companies exporting surveillance capabilities, particularly where reporters were likely to be at risk. “There are not enough safeguards about the export of the software,” he said. “Spyware has been sold directly to governments with terrible press freedom records, which is hard to understand.”\n\nNSO Group’s lawyers said the company “does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets”. However, they disputed that the numbers in the leak revealed the identities of NSO client’s surveillance targets, suggesting they may instead be part of a larger list of numbers used by their customers “for other purposes” that are legitimate and have nothing to do with surveillance or with NSO.\n\nNSO denied “false claims” made about the activities of its clients, but said that it would “continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action”. It said that in the past it had shut off client access to Pegasus where abuse had been confirmed.\n\nThe company added: “NSO Group is on a life-saving mission, and the company will faithfully execute this mission undeterred, despite any and all continued attempts to discredit it on false grounds.”",

It is also beyond dispute that the data has many legitimate and entirely proper uses having nothing to do with surveillance or with NSO, so there can be no factual basis to suggest that a use of the data somehow equates to surveillance.\n\nQuick Guide What is in the Pegasus project data? Show What is in the data leak? The data leak is a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group, which sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers were selected, or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared access with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the project, did the forensic analyses. What does the leak indicate? The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent, the presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the phone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company’s signature surveillance tool, or whether any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and US numbers, which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools, reveals some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with Pegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the start of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds. What did forensic analysis reveal? Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30, the tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced. Fifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful infection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of targeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages.

Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nNSO does not operate the systems that it sells to vetted government customers, and does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets. NSO does not operate its technology, does not collect, nor possesses, nor has any access to any kind of data of its customers. Due to contractual and national security considerations, NSO cannot confirm or deny the identity of our government customers, as well as identity of customers of which we have shut down systems.\n\nAs NSO has previously stated, our technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi. We can confirm that our technology was not used to listen, monitor, track, or collect information regarding him or his family members mentioned in your inquiry. We previously investigated this claim, which again, is being made without validation.\n\nForbidden Stories repeatedly imputes human rights abuses – including alleged murder and torture – to NSO Group based on alleged conduct by NSO Group’s clients and unsupported logical leaps.\n\nEven if Forbidden Stories were correct that an NSO Group client in Mexico targeted the journalist’s phone number in February 2017, that does not mean that the NSO Group client, or data collected by NSO Group software, were in any way connected to the journalist’s murder the following month. Correlation does not equal causation, and the gunmen who murdered the journalist could have learned of his location at a public carwash through any number of means not related to NSO Group, its technologies, or its clients.\n\nWe also stand by our previous statements that our products, sold to vetted foreign governments, cannot be used to conduct cybersurveillance within the United States, and no foreign customer has ever been granted technology that would enable them to access phones with US numbers. It is technologically impossible, and reaffirms the fact that your sources’ claims have no merit.\n\nNSO Group will continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action based on the results of these investigations. This includes shutting down of a customers’ system, something NSO has proven its ability and willingness to do, due to confirmed misuse, has done multiple times in the past, and will not hesitate to do again if a situation warrants. This process is documented in NSO Group’s “Transparency and Responsibility Report”, which was released last month.\n\nThe fact is NSO Group’s technologies have helped prevent terror attacks, gun violence, car explosions and suicide bombings. The technologies are also being used every day to break up paedophilia, sex- and drug-trafficking rings, locate missing and kidnapped children, locate survivors trapped under collapsed buildings, and protect airspace against disruptive penetration by dangerous drones.\n\nSimply put, NSO Group is on a life-saving mission, and the company will faithfully execute this mission undeterred, despite any and all continued attempts to discredit it on false grounds.\n\nGovernment responses to inquiries from the Pegasus project\n\nRwanda\n\nRwanda does not use this software system, as previously confirmed in November 2019, and does not possess this technical capability in any form. These false accusations are part of an ongoing campaign to cause tensions between Rwanda and other countries, and to sow disinformation about Rwanda domestically and internationally. This is libel, and enough is enough.\n\nThe questions related to ongoing terrorism trial of Paul Rusesabagina and his 20 co-accused have been extensively addressed by the court. For any future inquires related to cybersecurity, please contact the National Cyber Security Authority (NCSA).\n\nHungary\n\nWe are not aware of any alleged data collection claimed by the request.\n\nHungary is a democratic state governed by the rule of law, and as such, when it comes to any individual it has always acted and continues to act in accordance with the law in force. In Hungary, state bodies authorised to use covert instruments are regularly monitored by governmental and non-governmental institutions.\n\nHave you asked the same questions of the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany or France? In the case you have, how long did it take for them to reply and how did they respond? Was there any intelligence service to help you formulate the questions?\n\nMorocco\n\nMoroccan authorities do not understand the context of the request by the international journalist consortium Forbidden Stories asking for answers and clarifications from the Moroccan government about the digital surveillance tools of the NSO Group.\n\nWe remind you that the unfounded allegations already published by Amnesty International and relayed by Forbidden Stories have already been the subject of an official response by the Moroccan authorities, who categorically denied such allegations.\n\nThe Moroccan authorities have, since 22 June 2020, been awaiting material evidence from Amnesty International, which has been incapable of proving any relationship whatsoever between Morocco and the aforementioned Israeli company.\n\nIndia\n\nIndia is a robust democracy that is committed to ensuring the right to privacy to all its citizens as a fundamental right. In furtherance of this commitment, it has also introduced the personal data protection bill 2019 and the information technology (intermediary guidelines and digital media ethics code) rules 2021, to protect the personal data of individuals and to empower users of social media platforms.\n\nThe commitment to free speech as a fundamental right is the cornerstone of India’s democratic system. We have always strived to attain an informed citizenry with an emphasis on a culture of open dialogue.\n\nHowever, the questionnaire sent to the government of India indicates that the story being crafted is one that is not only bereft of facts but also founded in pre-conceived conclusions. It seems you are trying to play the role of an investigator, prosecutor as well as jury.\n\nConsidering the fact that answers to the queries posed have already been in public domain for a long time, it also indicates poorly conducted research and lack of due diligence by the esteemed media organisations involved.\n\nGovernment of India’s response to a right to information application about the use of Pegasus has been prominently reported by media and is in itself sufficient to counter any malicious claims about the alleged association between the government of India and Pegasus.\n\nIndia’s minister of electronics and IT has also spoken in detail, including in the parliament, that there has been no unauthorised interception by government agencies. It is important to note that government agencies have a well-established protocol for interception, which includes sanction and supervision from highly ranked officials in central and state governments, for clear stated reasons only in national interest.\n\nThe allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever. In the past, similar claims were made regarding the use of Pegasus on WhatsApp by Indian state. Those reports also had no factual basis and were categorically denied by all parties, including WhatsApp in the Indian supreme court.\n\nThis news report, thus, also appears to be a similar fishing expedition, based on conjectures and exaggerations to malign the Indian democracy and its institutions.\n\nIn India there is a well established procedure through which lawful interception of electronic communication is carried out in order for the purpose of national security, particularly on the occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety, by agencies at the centre and states. The requests for these lawful interception of electronic communication are made as per relevant rules under the provisions of section 5(2) of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and section 69 of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2000.\n\nEach case of interception, monitoring, and decryption is approved by the competent authority ie the union home secretary. These powers are also available to the competent authority in the state governments as per IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009.\n\nThere is an established oversight mechanism in the form of a review committee headed by the union cabinet secretary. In case of state governments, such cases are reviewed by a committee headed by the chief secretary concerned.\n\nThe procedure therefore ensures that any interception, monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource is done as per due process of law.\n\nThe governments of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan and Mexico did not respond to requests for comment.",

But his attackers knew exactly where to find him, even though the hammock where he lay was not visible from the street.\n\n“People with power can do whatever they want to anyone,” said his widow, Marisol Toledo, when told Pineda had been selected for potential targeting. “If they succeeded [in infecting his phone], they would have known where he was at all times.”\n\nOne of the alleged hitmen was found dead a few months later, but no one has been prosecuted over the murder.\n\nNSO says its products are only licensed for use by its clients to fight serious crime and terrorism.

The data, accessed by Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International, was shared with the Guardian and its 15 media partners.\n\nThe carwash where Pineda was shot dead on 2 March 2017.\n\nWhile the leak reveals phones that were selected as possible targets by NSO’s government clients, it is not possible to say whether phones were successfully infected with spyware without forensic analysis of a device.\n\nLawyers for NSO Group did not comment on whether Pineda’s phone had been targeted using its software. However, they said “even if” that were correct, “that does not mean that the NSO Group client or data collected by NSO Group software were in any way connected to the journalist’s murder the following month. Correlation does not equal causation, and the gunmen who murdered the journalist could have learned of his location at a public carwash through any number of means not related to NSO Group, its technologies, or its clients.”\n\nMexico is the world’s most dangerous country for reporters outside of warzones. Last month, two journalists were killed within a week, bringing the death toll to at least 86 since 2010, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Those most at risk are reporters who investigate the webs of influence and interest woven by organised crime, the security forces and corrupt officials.\n\nIt’s not the narcos who have absolute power – it’s the narco-politicians. Vania Pigeonutt, journalist\n\nIn Tierra Caliente, where Pineda lived and died, such pacts have long enabled cartels and politicians to cement their power and control this strategically important corridor used to transport drugs, arms and people.\n\nThis hot, dry region is heavily militarised, with federal and state security forces and intelligence agencies all operating in the region.\n\nLocal journalists must navigate opaque rules and direct threats dictating what must and cannot be covered. Reporters’ salaries are extremely low, and many – as Pineda did – rely on so-called gratitude payments for covering events.\n\n“This is the precarious reality in which Cecilio had to support his family, and while there’s no justification for accepting payments or gifts, you have to understand the context in which journalists live, work and die in Guerrero,” said Vania Pigeonutt, a journalist specialising in organised crime. “It’s impossible to keep everyone happy. And it’s not the narcos who have absolute power – it’s the narco-politicians.”\n\nPineda was afraid of blood, but when he went freelance in 2012 he quickly developed a reputation for exclusive reports from crime scenes. Toledo and former colleagues described him as hard-working, outgoing and socially minded – but also as a womaniser who liked to show off with fake designer clothes and cars bought on credit.\n\nHe did not smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs, but loved to eat tacos and watch movies with his two daughters. The family lived in one room, a sweltering converted garage at his mother’s house.\n\n“My son told me not to be scared, that he’d be fine,” said his mother, Crizanta Birto Melecio, 71, wiping away tears. “But he said: ‘If something happens to me, it will be the politicians.’”\n\nPineda frequently changed numbers because he feared his could be compromised, according to his colleagues and family. At one point, the transcript of a conversation between Pineda, a colleague and a source was published in a national newspaper.\n\nPineda with his friend Agustín Hernández, right.\n\nLike most local crime reporters, Pineda frequently received death threats. But while other journalists often tried to avoid trouble through self-censorship, Pineda played down the risks, said Agustín Hernández, a close friend and former colleague. “Cecilio would get into problems because he was so direct. We would tell him to take it easy but he always said everything would be fine,” he said.\n\nStill, Pineda had panic attacks and insomnia, and in 2015 he contacted the federal protection mechanism for human rights workers and journalists, a quasi-independent agency within the home affairs ministry.\n\nThe Guardian obtained a recording of Pineda’s final meeting with the mechanism in October 2016, when he voiced fears about a threat from the town of San Miguel Totolapan. The officials acknowledged the gravity of the situation but closed Pineda’s case because he refused to relocate to another state.\n\nIn the recording, he says he is managing the risks: “The people who could do me harm could hire killers, but they wouldn’t know my whereabouts.”\n\nA few weeks later he was selected as a possible target for surveillance by an NSO client.\n\nA picture of Pineda is displayed on his coffin.\n\nSan Miguel Totolapan is a mountainous municipality about 30 miles (50km) south-east of Ciudad Altamirano, and one of Guerrero’s main heroin poppy-growing areas.\n\nAt the time, the area was controlled by Los Tequileros, a local gang faction that split from the Familia Michoacana cartel in about 2012 and launched a wave of mass kidnappings that left dozens dead.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the political godfather of Los Tequileros was Saúl Beltrán Orozco, a local politician from the then ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). He has denied the allegations. Beltrán was also the local campaign coordinator for Héctor Astudillo, who was elected as state governor after pledging to bring “order and peace”.\n\nIn December 2016, armed locals captured the mother and friends of Los Tequileros’ chief in retaliation for the latest kidnappings. This new faction presented itself as a group of ordinary citizens fed up with crime, and Pineda sympathised with their cause, said Israel Flores, a local journalist. “He started naming the politicians who he believed to be responsible for what was happening. This was a mistake.”\n\nBut the group was actually aligned with the Familia Michoacana cartel, which was trying to recover lost territory. It is unclear if Pineda knew this, though he reported extensively on the crisis, accusing the state governor and security forces of protecting Los Tequileros.\n\nAs the violence intensified, one of NSO’s Mexican clients again highlighted Pineda’s phone number. Around the same time, the phone numbers of Beltrán and Astudillo also appeared in the data – as did the state’s chief prosecutor, Xavier Olea, who would later investigate the journalist’s death. Forensic analysis to determine whether the telephones of Beltrán, Astudillo or Olea were targeted was not possible.\n\nNeither Astudillo nor Beltrán responded to a request for comment.\n\nOlea, who was Guerrero’s attorney general between December 2015 and April 2018, had himself been given a demonstration of Israeli spyware. In an interview, he described how in early 2016 he was visited by two businessmen – an Israeli and a Mexican – who had been recommended by the federal anti-kidnapping commission.\n\nThe men said their software was capable of listening to calls and downloading WhatsApp messages. As part of their demonstration, they hacked the phone of Olea’s wife.\n\nOlea said he was impressed by the technology, but the budget for a deal was never approved. Two years later, the state governor agreed to buy the software, Olea said.\n\nOur investigation suggests Pineda was selected as a possible target by Mexico’s ministry of defence, NSO’s first client. Several state security forces are also believed to have access to spyware and close links between organised crime and politicians has prompted concerns it could end up in the wrong hands.\n\n“The line between the good guys and bad guys isn’t clear,” said Jorge Rebolledo, a security and intelligence consultant based in Mexico City.\n\nNSO said it did not operate the systems that it sells to vetted government customers to fight crime and terrorism, and did not have access to the data of its customers’ targets.\n\nBy February 2017, Pineda may have sensed that time was running out. He started reverse-parking his car and repeatedly asked his wife to check if the doors were locked. “That last week he seemed worried and scared,” said Toledo. “[But] he never told us any details – the less we know the better.”\n\nPineda broadcast his final report on 2 March, claiming that the state governor and elements of the state police knew exactly where Los Tequileros were hiding.\n\nWithin hours, he was dead.\n\nAdditional reporting by Paloma Dupont de Dinechin from Forbidden Stories",

In the case of journalists, that lets hackers spy on reporters’ communications with sources.\n\nAn investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military-grade malware from Israel-based NSO Group, the world’s most infamous hacker-for-hire outfit, is being used to spy on journalists, human rights activists and political dissidents.\n\nFrom a list of more than 50,000 cellphone numbers obtained by the Paris-based journalism non-profit Forbidden Stories and the human rights group Amnesty International and shared with 16 news organizations, journalists were able to identify more than 1,000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by NSO clients for potential surveillance.\n\nThey include 189 journalists, more than 600 politicians and government officials, at least 65 business executives, 85 human rights activists and several heads of state, according to The Washington Post, a consortium member. The journalists work for organizations including The Associated Press, Reuters, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, Le Monde and The Financial Times.\n\nAmnesty also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that NSO Group’s flagship Pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, just four days after he was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The company had previously been implicated in other spying activities on Khashoggi.\n\nNSO Group denied in an emailed response to AP questions that it has ever maintained “a list of potential, past or existing targets.” In a separate statement, it called the Forbidden Stories report “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories.”\n\nThe company reiterated its claims that it only sells to “vetted government agencies” for use against terrorists and major criminals and that it has no visibility into its customers’ data. Critics call those claims dishonest — and have provided evidence that NSO directly manages the high-tech spying. They say the repeated abuse of Pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry.\n\nThe source of the leak — and how it was authenticated -- was not disclosed. While a phone number’s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device, the consortium said it believed the data indicated potential targets of NSO’s government clients. The Post said it identified 37 hacked smartphones on the list. The Guardian, another consortium member, reported that Amnesty had found traces of Pegasus infections on the cellphones of 15 journalists who let their phones be examined after discovering their number was in the leaked data.\n\nThe most numbers on the list, 15,000, were for Mexican phones, with a large share in the Middle East. NSO Group’s spyware has been implicated in targeted surveillance chiefly in the Middle East and Mexico. Saudi Arabia is reported to be among NSO clients. Also on the lists were phones in countries including France, Hungary, India, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Pakistan.\n\nAlso Read New online platform maps Pegasus spread\n\n“The number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how Pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media. It is about controlling public narrative, resisting scrutiny, and suppressing any dissenting voice,” Amnesty quoted its secretary-general, Agnes Callamard, as saying.\n\nIn one case highlighted by the Guardian, Mexican reporter Cecilio Pineda Birto was assassinated in 2017 a few weeks after his cell phone number appeared on the leaked list.\n\nAP’s director of media relations, Lauren Easton, said the company is “deeply troubled to learn that two AP journalists, along with journalists from many news organizations” are on the list of the 1,000 potential targets for Pegasus infection. She said the AP was investigating to try to determine if its two staffers’ devices were compromised by the spyware.\n\nThe consortium’s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers, primarily from the University of Toronto-based watchdog Citizen Lab. NSO targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of Al-Jazeera journalists and executives, New York Times Beirut bureau chief Ben Hubbard, Moroccan journalist and activist Omar Radi and prominent Mexican anti-corruption reporter Carmen Aristegui. Her phone number was on the list, the Post reported. The Times said Hubbard and its former Mexico City bureau chief, Azam Ahmed, were on the list.\n\nTwo Hungarian investigative journalists, Andras Szabo and Szabolcs Panyi, were among journalists on the list whose phones were successfully infected with Pegasus, the Guardian reported.\n\nAmong more than two dozen previously documented Mexican targets are proponents of a soda tax, opposition politicians, human rights activists investigating a mass disappearance and the widow of a slain journalist. In the Middle East, the victims have mostly been journalists and dissidents, allegedly targeted by the Saudi and United Arab Emirates governments.\n\nThe consortium’s “Pegasus Project” reporting bolsters accusations that not just autocratic regimes but democratic governments, including India and Mexico, have used NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware for political ends. Its members, who include Le Monde and Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Germany, are promising a series of stories based on the leak.\n\nPegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone’s microphones and cameras. In the case of journalists, that lets hackers spy on reporters’ communications with sources.\n\nThe program is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity. NSO Group’s methods to infect its victims have grown so sophisticated that researchers say it can now do so without any user interaction, the so-called “zero-click” option.\n\nIn 2019, WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook sued NSO Group in U.S. federal court in San Francisco, accusing it of exploiting a flaw in the popular encrypted messaging service to target — with missed calls alone — some 1,400 users. NSO Group denies the accusations.\n\nThe Israeli company was sued the previous year in Israel and Cyprus, both countries from which it exports products. The plaintiffs include Al-Jazeera journalists, as well as other Qatari, Mexican and Saudi journalists and activists who say the company’s spyware was used to hack them.\n\nSeveral of the suits draw heavily on leaked material provided to Abdullah Al-Athbah, editor of the Qatari newspaper Al-Arab and one of the alleged victims. The material appears to show officials in the United Arab Emirates discussing whether to hack into the phones of senior figures in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, including members of the Qatari royal family.\n\nNSO Group does not disclose its clients and says it sells its technology to Israeli-approved governments to help them target terrorists and break up pedophile rings and sex- and drug-trafficking rings. It claims its software has helped save thousands of lives and denies its technology was in any way associated with Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nNSO Group also denies involvement in elaborate undercover operations uncovered by The AP in 2019 in which shadowy operatives targeted NSO critics including a Citizen Lab researcher to try to discredit them.\n\nLast year, an Israeli court dismissed an Amnesty International lawsuit seeking to strip NSO of its export license, citing insufficient evidence.\n\nNSO Group is far from the only merchant of commercial spyware. But its behavior has drawn the most attention, and critics say that is with good reason.\n\nLast month, it published its first transparency report, in which it says it has rejected “more than $300 million in sales opportunities as a result of its human rights review processes.” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a strident critic, tweeted: “If this report was printed, it would not be worth the paper it was printed on.”\n\nA new, interactive online data platform created by the group Forensic Architecture with support from Citizen Lab and Amnesty International catalogs NSO Group’s activities by country and target. The group partnered with filmmaker Laura Poitras, best known for her 2014 documentary “Citzenfour” about NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who offers video narrations.\n\n“Stop what you’re doing and read this,” Snowden tweeted Sunday, referencing the consortium’s findings. “This leak is going to be the story of the year.”\n\nSince 2019, the U.K. private equity firm Novalpina Capital has controlled a majority stake in NSO Group. Earlier this year, Israeli media reported the company was considering an initial public offering, most likely on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.",

Photo shows Youth Congress workers protesting in New Delhi on July 20, 2021. | Photo Credit: PTI\n\n25 July 2021 02:22 IST\n\nIn light of the Pegasus spyware scandal, what are the checks and balances to prevent abuse of procedures?\n\nThe story so far: An international group of news publications are reporting that a spyware known as Pegasus has been used to spy on politicians, journalists, and activists, primarily in 10 countries. Reports from the grouping called the Pegasus Project, which includes The Wire in India, The Guardian in the U.K., and The Washington Post in the U.S., suggest that in India, at least 40 journalists, Cabinet Ministers, and holders of constitutional positions were possibly subjected to surveillance. The reports are based on a database of about 50,000 phone numbers accessed by the Paris-based non-profit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International, which they say are numbers of interest to clients of NSO, the Israel-based company that created Pegasus. According to The Guardian, Amnesty International’s Security Lab has tested 67 of the phones linked to these numbers and found that “23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration”.\n\nWhat do we know about Pegasus?\n\nPegasus can take multiple routes to reach a target’s phone. Its earliest avatars used spear phishing, a hit-or-miss method in which a malicious link is embedded in a message customised to entice the target to click. However, it has now evolved to include “zero-click” attacks, where the target need not take any action for the phone to be infected. In 2019, WhatsApp released a statement saying that Pegasus could enter phones via calls made on the platform, even if they were not attended. Pegasus uses several such “exploits”, or weaknesses, in Android and Apple phones to enter phones; and many of these exploits are reportedly “zero day”, which means it is not a weakness that the device manufacturers are aware of. Forbidden Stories reports that frequently used exploits are bugs in iPhone’s iMessage communication app. Pegasus can also be delivered over the air from a nearby wireless transmitter, or manually inserted if the target phone is physically available.\n\nAlso Read NSO Group | The merchant of faceless agents Advertising Advertising\n\nOnce inside the phone, Pegasus seeks “root privileges”, Claudio Guarnieri, who runs Amnesty International’s Security Lab, told The Guardian. Root privileges is a level of control over the phone that is beyond what a regular user has. It enables Pegasus to set up shop within the phone and establish communications with its controllers through an anonymised network of internet addresses and servers. It can then start transmitting any data stored on the phone to its command-and-control centres. This level of control also means Pegasus can turn on the phone’s cameras and microphones to turn it into a spying device without the owner’s knowledge.\n\nWho are its clients?\n\nThe NSO Group which developed Pegasus officially claims it has 60 clients in 40 countries, though the company has not revealed their identities. Going by the Pegasus Project’s analysis of the phone numbers that the spyware possibly targeted, its clients have interests primarily in 10 countries: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nReading this together with NSO’s statement that Pegasus is graded as a cyberweapon and can be sold only to authorised government entities as per Israeli law, most reports have suggested that the governments in these countries are the clients.\n\nAlso Read Pegasus | How to find out if your phone was infected with the spyware\n\nForbidden Stories is also reporting that the Israeli Ministry of Defence has a significant role in deciding whom NSO sells the software to, and apparently got it sold to Saudi Arabia despite the company’s reservations. This is significant as reports have indicated that Pegasus was used to spy on Jamal Khashoggi before the Saudi journalist and dissident was lured to the kingdom’s embassy in Turkey and assassinated. In India, the government has neither confirmed nor denied that it has purchased the NSO software at any point of time.\n\nWho has been targeted?\n\nThe NSO has stated that Pegasus is not a tool for mass surveillance, but the 10,000 numbers that are in the Moroccan cluster of the database suggest otherwise, says Forbidden Stories. While the stated aim of Pegasus is to fight crime and terrorism, the database also has the numbers of over 200 journalists worldwide, including 40 from Indian media houses such as The Wire, The Hindu, and Hindustan Times.\n\nThe database also contains the numbers of about 13 heads of state, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, who has probably been spied on from Morocco; South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, probably spied on from Rwanda; and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, probably spied on from India.\n\nA cluster of 2,000 Indian and Pakistani phone numbers, identified as being of possible interest to the Indian client, has the contacts for Opposition politicians, civil rights activists, and judges.\n\nWhat do Indian laws outline?\n\nSection 5(2) of The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, states that the government can intercept a “message or class of messages” when it is “in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of an offence”.\n\nThe operational process and procedures for it appear in Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951. Rule 419A was added to the Telegraph Rules in 2007 after the verdict in the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) vs Union of India case in 1996, in which the Supreme Court said telephonic conversations are covered by the right to privacy, which can be breached only if there are established procedures. Under Rule 419A, surveillance needs the sanction of the Home Secretary at the Central or State level, but in “unavoidable circumstance” can be cleared by a Joint Secretary or officers above, if they have the Home Secretary’s authorisation.\n\nIn the K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India verdict of 2017, the Supreme Court further reiterated the need for oversight of surveillance, stating that it should be legally valid and serve a legitimate aim of the government. The court also said the means adopted should be proportional to the need for surveillance, and there should be procedures to check any abuse of surveillance.\n\nThe second legislation enabling surveillance is Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which deals with electronic surveillance. It facilitates government “interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource” if it is in the interest of the “sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order” or for preventing or investigating any cognizable offence.\n\nThe procedure for electronic surveillance as authorised by Section 69 is detailed in the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009. These rules, according to Apar Gupta, lawyer and executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, are very broad and allow even the redirection of traffic to false websites or the planting of any device to acquire any information.\n\nMr. Gupta is of the opinion that the use of Pegasus is illegal as it constitutes unauthorised access under Section 66 of the Information Technology Act.\n\nSection 66 prescribes punishment to anyone who gains unauthorised access to computers and “downloads, copies or extracts any data”, or “introduces or causes to be introduced any computer contaminant or computer virus,” as laid down in Section 43.",

The numbers for King Mohammed VI, Mr. Tedros’s staffer and former Italian Prime Minister were also found in that group. Morocco has “categorically rejected” claims that its intelligence services had used Pegasus to monitor critics at home and abroad.\n\nPakistan Prime Minister Khan’s numbers appeared in a group dominated by Indian targets, the Post reported. Mr. Salih and Mr. Hariri were found among numbers dominated by the UAE and Saudi groups. Pakistan’s government has said it is investigating whether a number used by Prime Minister Khan was compromised.

Washington Post executive editor Sally Buzbee explained it in a letter from the editor on Sunday afternoon. “The project was conceived by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based journalism nonprofit, which, along with Amnesty International, a human rights group, had access to records that formed the basis of our reporting: a list of more than 50,000 cellphone numbers concentrated in countries known to surveil their citizens and also known to have been clients of NSO Group,” Buzbee wrote.\n\n“Although the purpose of the list could not be conclusively determined, it is a fascinating document,” Buzbee wrote. “Out of the more than 1,000 identities that could be confirmed, there were at least 85 human rights activists, 65 business executives, several members of Arab royal families, 189 journalists, and 600 government officials and politicians, spread across more than 50 countries.”\n\nAmnesty’s Security Lab was able to examine 67 smartphones. “Of those, 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration,” WaPo reported. “For the remaining 30, the tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the phones had been replaced.”\n\nWaPo interviewed some of the affected individuals, including Siddharth Varadarajan, co-founder of The Wire, a nonprofit news outlet in India. “This is an incredible intrusion, and journalists should not have to deal with this,” he said after learning that his phone was infected. “Nobody should have to deal with this.”\n\nWho’s on the list?\n\nHere’s what WaPo reported: “Among the journalists whose numbers appear on the list, which dates to 2016, are reporters working overseas for several leading news organizations, including a small number from CNN, the Associated Press, Voice of America, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News, Le Monde in France, the Financial Times in London and Al Jazeera in Qatar.”\n\nThere’s a whole lot of uncertainty associated with this, as Devan Cole noted in a story for CNN.com. But Amnesty’s secretary-general, Agnes Callamard, came out swinging. “The number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how Pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media. It is about controlling public narrative, resisting scrutiny, and suppressing any dissenting voice,” Callamard said Sunday.\n\nI was also struck by this line in the WaPo story: “After the investigation began, several reporters in the consortium learned that they or their family members had been successfully attacked with Pegasus spyware.”\n\n“Out in the open…”\n\nCNN has not independently verified the findings of the Pegasus Project probe. The seventeen participating outlets are Forbidden Stories, The Washington Post, Le Monde, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Die Zeit, The Guardian, Daraj, Direkt36, Le Soir, Knack, Radio France, The Wire, Proceso, Aristegui Noticias, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Haaretz and PBS “Frontline.”\n\nFor an overview of the findings thus far, “Frontline” is running a live blog linking to major stories from the other partners.\n\nHere’s the key quote from Dana Priest, one of the bylines on the WaPo report, who is also featured in a “Frontline” report. “For the first time,” Priest said, “we’ve been able to give readers a sense of just how enormous the private and unregulated spying business has become. It’s been a unique, and actually thrilling, experience to work with so many foreign journalists to pool our sources and resources to bring this difficult story out in the open, where it should be.”\n\nNSO Group’s response\n\nQuoting from Devan Cole’s story: “In a lengthy statement to CNN on Sunday, NSO Group strongly denied the investigation’s findings, saying in part that it sells its ‘technologies solely to law enforcement and intelligence agencies of vetted governments for the sole purpose of saving lives through preventing crime and terror acts.’”\n\nNSO Group also said it “does not operate the system and has no visibility to the data.” It said it will continue to investigate “all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action based on the results” of such investigations…",

                        "docText": "NEW YORK — This week has seen major social media sites step up their policing of online disinformation campaigns.\n\nGoogle disabled dozens of YouTube channels and other accounts linked to a state-run Iranian broadcaster running a political-influence campaign.\n\nFacebook removed 652 suspicious pages, groups and accounts linked to Russia and Iran.\n\nTwitter took similar action shortly thereafter.\n\nWhat did they have in common? The security firm FireEye.\n\nBest known for its work on high-profile cyberattacks against companies including Target, JPMorgan Chase and Sony Pictures, FireEye is emerging as a key player in the fight against election interference and disinformation campaigns.\n\n\n\nThis undated image provided by the cybersecurity firm FireEye shows a Tweet from a social media persona related to a group called “Liberty Front Press” using the Twitter handle “@Berniecratss.” FireEye called the group an influence operation apparently aimed at promoting Iranian political interests. The group had multiple social media personas that masqueraded as liberal U.S. activists. (FireEye via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nFounded in 2004, FireEye is based in Silicon Valley and staffed with a roster of former military and law-enforcement cyberexperts.\n\n“They’ve really become the Navy SEALs of cybersecurity, especially for next-generation cybersecurity threats,” said GBH Insights analyst Dan Ives.\n\nLee Foster, manager of information operations analysis at FireEye, said his team works within the company’s intelligence outfit, which researches not only “info-ops” — like the Iran-linked social media activity it recently uncovered — but espionage, financial crime and other forms of vulnerability and exploitation. Specialist teams at FireEye focus on particular areas of cyberthreats, each with their own expertise and language capabilities.\n\n“We kind of operate like a private-sector intelligence operation,” he said.\n\nFireEye was founded by Ashar Aziz, who developed a system for spotting threats that haven’t been tracked before, unlike older companies that sold firewalls or anti-virus programs that block known malware.\n\nAziz, a former Sun Microsystems engineer, created a system that uses software to simulate a computer network and check programs for suspicious behavior, before allowing them into the network itself.\n\nFireEye raised its profile in 2014 by acquiring Mandiant, known for expertise in assessing damage and tracing the source of cyberattacks. Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia, a former U.S. Air Force investigator, is now FireEye’s CEO.\n\nWhile businesses are spending more on information security, FireEye itself has spent heavily on research, development, sales and marketing. That has led to struggles to remain profitable, as heavy investments offset revenue growth.\n\nMandia said that during the three months ended June 30, FireEye’s email security found 6 million spear-phishing attacks, a type of hacking, and its security products alerted companies of attempts to breach security 29 million times. That’s important, Mandia said, because most of FireEye’s products are deployed behind their client’s existing firewalls or antivirus software, so everything FireEye catches has already evaded other defenses, he said.\n\n“We are the investigators called in when the processes, people, and technology fail to prevent a security breach or incident,” he said. “We find the gaps in the security fabric and we find the needle in the haystack.”\n\nFireEye Inc.’s second-quarter revenue rose 6 percent to $203 million but it lost $72.9 million, or 38 cents per share. That met Wall Street’s expectations, but its shares fell as investors expected more.\n\nThat’s a common problem in the white-hot cybersecurity sector, which includes competitors like Palo Alto Networks, CloudFlare and Check Point. The companies are facing high expectations as the cybersecurity market booms, fueled by heightened cyberattacks and hacking fears.\n\n“As the space has become more competitive ... profitability and growth has been a challenge for (FireEye),” Ives said.\n\nStill, FireEye’s stock jumped 6 percent on Thursday when news broke of its role in uncovering the fake accounts on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. It was up another 3 percent Friday.\n\nFireEye shares hit their all-time peak of $95.63 on March 5, 2014, a few months after they went public, but began a long decline after that, hitting an all-time low of $10.40 almost exactly three years later on March 14, 2017. In the past month the stock has traded between $14.38 and $16.69.\n\nAnd the company’s reputation continues to grow.\n\n“There are many vendors that play in cybersecurity when you look at some of the very sophisticated threats facing enterprise and governments,” Ives said. “FireEye many times gets that first phone call when it comes to assess threat environment for companies.”\n\n___\n\nAP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay in New York contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\n\nThrough a network of fake news websites and fraudulent social media personas spread across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus and YouTube, the Iranian-linked campaign pushed narratives in line with the country’s interests.\n\nThe campaign was aimed at users in the United States, Britain, Latin America and Middle East up through this month, according to an analysis by the cybersecurity company FireEye Inc (FEYE.O), which first spotted the behavior.\n\nRussia has been linked to similar online influence campaigns, including an effort to sow political divisions among U.S. voters, but FireEye said its findings showed that the same tactics are now being used for different aims.\n\nU.S. lawmakers echoed the sentiment.\n\n“It really shows it’s not just Russia that engages in this type of activity,” Lee Foster, an information operations analyst with FireEye, told Reuters.\n\nThe firm said the Iranian activity included “anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes” and advocacy of policies favorable to Iran such as the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal.\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe finding comes as concerns are rising about foreign attempts to disrupt the U.S. midterm election in November.\n\nMicrosoft on Monday said that hackers linked to the Russian government sought to steal email login credentials from U.S. politicians and think tanks.\n\nFireEye said the Iranian activity did not appear “dedicated” to influencing the upcoming election, though some of the posts aimed at U.S. users did adopt “left-leaning identities” and took stances against President Donald Trump.\n\nThat activity “could suggest a more active attempt to influence domestic U.S. political discourse” is forthcoming, Foster said, but “we just haven’t seen that yet.”\n\n‘COORDINATED INFLUENCE’\n\nFireEye said the U.S.-focused activity ramped up last year, just months after Trump took office, with websites and social media accounts posting memes and articles, some of which were apparently copied from legitimate U.S. and Iranian news outlets.\n\nIn some cases, the domains for the fake websites like “US Journal” and “Liberty Free Press” were originally registered years before the 2016 election, in 2014 and 2013, but most remained inactive until last year, FireEye said.\n\nArabic-language, Middle East-focused websites appear to be part of the same campaign, the company added.\n\nThe technology companies variously said they linked the accounts to Iran based on user phone numbers, email addresses, website registration records and the timing of account activity matching Iranian business hours.\n\nFireEye expressed “moderate confidence” about the Iranian origins, but said it has not been able to tie the accounts back to a specific organization or individuals.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people followed one or more of the Facebook pages implicated in the campaign, Facebook said.\n\nIt shared examples of removed posts, including a cartoon depicting an Israeli soldier executing a Palestinian and a fake movie poster showing President Trump embracing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nPostings cited by FireEye expressed praise for U.S. politicians and other Twitter users who criticized the Trump administration’s decision in May to abandon the Iranian nuclear pact, under which Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear weapons program in exchange for loosening of sanctions.\n\nSome Twitter and Facebook accounts were designed to appear as if they were real people in the U.S., Britain and Canada, according to FireEye. The accounts used a combination of different hashtags to engage in U.S. culture, including “#lockhimup,” “#impeachtrump” and “notmypresident.”\n\nTwitter, which called the effort “coordinated manipulation,” said it removed 284 accounts.\n\nFacebook said it removed 254 pages and 392 accounts across its flagship platform as well as its Instagram service. Some of the accounts had events and groups associated with them.\n\nThe accounts spent about $12,000 to advertise through Facebook and Instagram using a variety of currencies, Facebook said. The company said it had notified the U.S. Treasury and State departments of the purchases, which may potentially violate sanctions.\n\nAlphabet, which includes Google and YouTube, did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nFacebook said on Tuesday that it also removed some accounts tied to “sources the US government has previously identified as Russian military intelligence services.”\n\nThose accounts engaged in “inauthentic behavior” related to politics in Syria and Ukraine, Facebook said, while noting that the activity does not appear linked to the Iran campaign.\n\nFacebook last month removed 32 pages and accounts tied to another misinformation campaign without describing its origins.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment after hours.",

                        "docText": "\n\nFormer special counsel Robert S. Mueller III warned Wednesday that Russia is trying to interfere in the 2020 election. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nA recent tweet from Alicia Hernan — whose Twitter account described her as a wife, mother and lover of peace — did not mince words about her feelings for President Trump: “That stupid moron doesn’t get that that by creating bad guys, spewing hate filled words and creating fear of ‘others’, his message is spreading to fanatics around the world. Or maybe he does.”\n\nThat March 16 tweet, directed to a Hawaii congressman, was not the work of an American voter venting her frustration. The account, “@AliciaHernan3,” was what disinformation researchers call a “sock puppet” — a type of fictitious online persona used by Russians when they were seeking to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut it was Iranians, not Russians, who created @AliciaHernan3, complete with a picture of a blonde woman with large, round-framed glasses and a turtleneck sweater. It was one of more than 7,000 phony accounts from Iran that Twitter has shut down this year alone.\n\nAnd Iran is far from the only nation that has, within its borders, substantial capacity to wage Russian-style influence operations in the United States ahead of next year’s election. That means American voters are likely to be targeted in the coming campaign season by more foreign disinformation than ever before, say those studying such operations.\n\nFormer special counsel Robert S. Mueller III echoed the consensus of independent researchers in his congressional testimony Wednesday, saying of Russian online political interference, “It wasn’t a single attempt. They’re doing it as we sit here, and they expect to do it the next campaign.” He then added that “many more countries” had developed similar capabilities, based in part on the Russian playbook.\n\nA short list of countries that host online influence operations with a history of meddling across borders includes Saudi Arabia, Israel, China, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, researchers say.\n\nThey say it’s not often not clear exactly who runs these operations — whether it’s the governments themselves or some other actors — but they typically echo the talking points of the ruling powers and back their geopolitical goals through tweets, posts and online videos. Operations in all of these countries, meanwhile, have the means and potentially the motives to seek to influence an American election shaping up as among the most hotly contested in decades.\n\nThe influence operations in these countries, however, do not all share Russia’s demonstrated preference for Trump and other Republicans. The Iranians, for example, typically oppose Trump in their disinformation messaging, criticizing his decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and administration policy on other issues, including Israel and the civil wars in Yemen and Syria, research shows.\n\n“Multiple foreign actors have demonstrated an ability and willingness to leverage these kinds of influence operations in pursuit of their geopolitical goals,” said Lee Foster, head of the intelligence team investigating information operations for FireEye, a cybersecurity firm based in California. “We risk the U.S. information space becoming a free-for-all for foreign interference if, as a society, we fail to get an effective grasp on this problem.”\n\nResearchers for FireEye and other firms have reported suspected Iranian disinformation on most major social media platform — Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google+ and others -- and on standalone websites as well. In May, FireEye also alleged that U.S. news sites may have been tricked into publishing letters to the editor penned by Iranian operatives.\n\nThe firm’s analysis spotted a number of instances where letters in newspapers in Virginia and Texas appeared to share similar characteristics to accounts on Twitter believed to be part of an Iran-based disinformation network. FireEye also catalogued fictitious Twitter personas used by Iranians including a Harvard student, a Michigan bodybuilder and an Iran-American woman from Seattle.\n\nSome Iranian Twitter accounts, FireEye found, even sought to impersonate U.S. political candidates, including a California Republican who ultimately lost the general election for Congress. That account tweeted about the confirmation hearing for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and a British royal wedding before beginning to promote Iranian interests, including tweets condemning the Saudis’ killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSome Iranian disinformation accounts, some of which were affiliated with state-controlled news operations, date back several years, but they have grown steadily more sophisticated. Twitter, Facebook and Google all have identified and taken offline accounts from Iran over the past year for engaging in coordinated, deceptive behavior.\n\n“As part of our public archive of information operations, we have disclosed thousands of accounts and millions of Tweets originating in Iran that we have proactively removed,” said Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of site integrity. “Every year is an election year on Twitter, and we will be applying all of our global learnings to protect and enhance conversations around the 2020 election.”\n\nThe Iranian tactics differ somewhat from those of the Russians, who through the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg infiltrated the online conversations of a wide range of U.S. political groupings — immigration opponents, African Americans, veterans, evangelical Christians, environmentalists — with a range of messages, attuned to the way those communities already were speaking to each other on major online platforms.\n\nThe Iranian operations detected so far tend to lack that complexity, with messaging typically on a single side of an issue in line with government policy goals — countering Israel, for example — as opposed to multiple ones.\n\nBut there are clear signs of shifting tactics in the accounts identified by Twitter, Facebook and other companies so far. What’s known, researchers say, may be only small parts of much larger operations that remain undetected.\n\n“The Iranian operations were a wake-up call to remind us that the Russians were not the only ones doing information operations,” said Camille Francois, chief innovation officer for Graphika, a network analysis firm based in New York that studies online disinformation.\n\nGraphika found that among one set of 1,666 Iranian accounts taken down by Twitter in June, about one in four tweets were in English. Trump was mentioned more than 1,400 times — almost always in critical ways — with this anti-Trump tweeting peaking in early 2017, in the months around when he took office.\n\nResearchers say that both the U.S. government and social media companies have grown more aggressive in battling online disinformation in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCooperation between the FBI and Silicon Valley has improved markedly. U.S. Cyber Command blocked Internet access to Russian disinformation teams during the congressional midterm vote in November 2018, scrambling operations. Some researchers express hope that this rising aggressiveness may thwart — or at least deter — some foreign-based influence operations from meddling in future U.S. elections.\n\nAll of the major social media companies also have established teams devoted to combating disinformation, typically by identifying and shutting down networks of fictitious, foreign-based accounts on an increasingly large scale.\n\nThis shift has been dramatic since 2016, when the companies saw foreign threats mainly in terms of traditional cybersecurity — hacks and bugs — as opposed to influence operations conducted by foreign adversaries with substantial resources. The Russian disinformation campaign in 2016 spent more than $1 million a month, Mueller reported in an indictment last year against the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAs the companies crack down, the tactics of disinformation teams rapidly shift to improve operational security and more effectively evade detection. FireEye, for example, was able to identify some apparently fake Iranian accounts last year because contact numbers for supposed American Twitter users had the +98 country code from Iran, a tactical mistake operatives are unlikely to make again.\n\nBut, among independent researchers and some lawmakers, significant skepticism remains on whether enough has been done to prepare for the threat in 2020.\n\n“In 2016, Russia used bots and fake accounts to launch an unprecedented social media campaign designed to influence the results of our presidential election,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “That playbook is out in the open now, and you can bet that unless the platform companies get their acts together, we’re going to see more and more foreign-based actors using it to wreak havoc in our democratic process.”\n\nThe nations hosting significant disinformation capabilities typically first saw them active in seeking to manipulate domestic audiences, shaping public perceptions in line with regime propaganda. The next step often was working regionally, by infiltrating online conversations in neighboring countries, as Russia did in Ukraine in 2014 as it annexed Crimea and fomented unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\nDisinformation teams in Iran initially developed their tactics while manipulating domestic political conversation before gradually expanding operations to include more languages, more themes and foreign targets.\n\nHuman rights lawyer Simin Kargar, of Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, said Iran for years has harassed journalists, political dissidents and artists in its internal disinformation campaigns. She has watched as Iran increasingly deployed such tactics against foreign targets.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if the Iranians weren’t trying to expand their operations for the coming election, especially with the rising tensions between Iran and the United States,” said Kargar. “They would be far more savvy by 2020. I wouldn’t be surprised if they weren’t just trying to harness as much division as possible.”\n\nDisinformation teams in Saudi Arabia have worked both internally and to manipulate other Gulf states, including in the nation’s struggle with rival Qatar, said researcher Mark Owen Jones, an assistant professor of Middle East Studies at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Doha, the capital of Qatar. He said tactics in Saudi Arabia typically involve both sock puppets and automated accounts, called “bots,” echoing official government propaganda, including things said or tweeted by Trump.\n\nJones recently detailed in a series of tweets an apparent information operation emanating from Saudi Arabia following a visit to the White House this month by Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar. Jones found a single tweet, “The Prince of Qatar a supporter of terrorism, should not be in the White House but be at Guantanamo,” had been posted up to 800 times an hour over several days, from 2,582 unique accounts. The tweets mostly were directed at U.S.-based targets, including Trump, the CIA and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and at several news organizations, including Fox News, Reuters and The Washington Post.\n\n“There’s still this pro-Trump message coming from Saudi Twitter, and I don’t think that’s likely to change,” Jones said. “They view Trump’s re-election as key to their own survival.”\n\nThe Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nThis trajectory from nationally focused to internationally focused disinformation campaigns raises longer-term worries about what other nations might have disinformation teams sharpening their chops on domestic audiences with an eye toward eventual use against foreign targets, including in the United States. In addition to those with known foreign disinformation capabilities, there are numerous nations — Turkey, Egypt, the Philippines, Qatar, Mexico and others — that now use such tactics mainly to influence domestic politics but could turn their attention to foreign targets.\n\nIn a related trend, online mercenaries have begun offering information operations as a commercial service. Facebook shut down 265 accounts from an Israeli company, Archimedes Group, in May for seeking to manipulate elections through social media targeting voters in Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia. The company said on its website that it would “use every tool and take every advantage available in order to change reality according to our client’s wishes.”",

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nThe findings show how unidentified, possibly government-backed, groups could manipulate social media platforms to promote stories and other content that can influence the opinions of American voters, the researchers said.\n\nThis particular operation was largely focused on promoting “anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes,” according to the report by FireEye.\n\nThe campaign was organized through a series of fake personas that created various social media accounts, including on Twitter and Facebook. Most of these accounts were created last year and have since been taken down, the report said.\n\nSpokespersons for Twitter and Facebook confirmed FireEye’s finding that the fake accounts were created on their platforms.\n\nLee Foster, a researcher with FireEye, said he found some of the fake personas - often masquerading as American journalists - had successfully convinced several U.S. news outlets to publish letters to the editor, guest columns and blog posts.\n\nThese writings displayed both progressive and conservative views, the report said, covering topics including the Trump administration’s designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.\n\n“We’re assessing with low confidence that this network was organized to support Iranian political interests,” said Foster. “However, we’re not at the point where we can say who was doing it or where it’s coming from. The investigation is ongoing.”\n\nBefore the 2018 midterms election, the nameless group created Twitter accounts that also impersonated both Republican and Democratic congressional candidates. It is unclear if the fake accounts had any effect on their campaigns.\n\nThe imposter Twitter accounts often plagiarized messages from the politicians’ legitimate accounts, but also mixed in posts voicing support for policies believed to be favorable to Tehran. Affected politicians included Jineea Butler, a Republican candidate for New York’s 13th District, and Marla Livengood, a Republican candidate for California’s 9th District. Both Livengood and Butler lost in the election.\n\nLivengood’s campaign called the situation “clearly an attempt by bad actors” to hurt her campaign, and noted that Livengood was “a strident opponent of nuclear weapons in Iran.”\n\nButler could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTwitter said in a statement that it had “removed this network of 2,800 inauthentic accounts originating in Iran at the beginning of May,” adding that its investigation was ongoing.\n\nFacebook said it had removed 51 Facebook accounts, 36 Pages, seven Groups and three Instagram accounts connected to the influence operation. Instagram is owned by Facebook.\n\nThe activity on Facebook was less expansive than that on Twitter and it appeared to be more narrowly focused, said Facebook head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher. The inauthentic Facebook accounts instead often privately messaged high profile figures, including journalists, policy-makers and Iranian dissidents, to promote certain issues.\n\nFacebook also concluded the activity had originated in Iran.",

Those from one firm, FireEye, even released hacking tools in 2019 showing exactly how to do it — in hopes that the revelation would spur the widespread deployment of better defenses.\n\nIt didn’t.\n\nNow there is urgent debate within cybersecurity circles about how best to respond to the hack, which was so extensive that experts describe it as historic.\n\nAD\n\nSome are calling for stronger walls to keep out would-be intruders or better burglar alarms to alert network administrators that a hack had begun. Others, arguing that there’s no practical way to keep the most sophisticated hackers from breaking into important networks, say the smarter investment would be in building better tools for hunting and ejecting intruders once they inevitably get past security perimeters.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, questions remain about why this surge of corrective action didn’t happen earlier for a type of hack that had been discussed for years within cybersecurity circles and whether, even now, the potential solutions are being deployed widely enough to prevent future catastrophes.\n\nTwo months after the hack was discovered in December, cybersecurity researchers say spies are probably still active in some of the hundreds of breached networks. Victims included the departments of State, Treasury, Homeland Security, Energy and Commerce, and the National Institutes of Health and the National Nuclear Security Administration. Also penetrated were private companies in the consulting, technology, telecom, and oil and gas companies in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as well as FireEye itself, which first reported the attack on Dec. 8.\n\nThe Russians used a variety of sophisticated tricks to penetrate the networks in last year’s attack. But once inside, they often manipulated a piece of Microsoft software, Active Directory Federation Services, that vouches for the identities of authorized users by issuing digital identity documents called “SAML tokens.” An Israeli researcher had first described this technique, dubbed a “Golden SAML Attack,” in 2017, but it had not been seen in a major network intrusion until now, experts say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch systems for authenticating users are essential to securing the cloud services used widely by government agencies, corporations, hospitals, universities and most other places where people collaborate across long distances. And the ability to forge SAML tokens lets hackers roam widely among these cloud-based services, while also minimizing the chances of getting quickly caught.\n\n“All of this outward security doesn’t mean squat if you don’t have this one thing locked up,” said Matthew D. Green, a Johns Hopkins cybersecurity and cryptology expert. “This is crazy.\"\n\nAuthenticated SAML (rhymes with “camel”) tokens let intruders move easily among the computer systems affiliated with an organization, even if the individual elements are run by different companies, such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services or Dropbox. Hackers can present these tokens as they seek access to different troves of valuable data — email, document repositories, payroll systems — while sidestepping common defensive measures, such as strong passwords and two-factor authentication.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are possible protections against a Golden SAML Attack, including securing the encryption keys that create the tokens in their own, well-defended piece of hardware, or sharply limiting who has high-level access to the computers authorized to issue tokens. Alerts warning of unusual behavior might help defenders act more quickly, and more extensive logging could help the detective work after signs of trouble are detected.\n\nFormer National Security Agency hacker Jake Williams said his security consultancy has been helping clients respond to the recent Russian attack. But even now, it’s not entirely clear to him which defenses are best suited to prevent a repeat, given the sophistication of the attackers, which U.S. officials have said were from the SVR, Russian’s foreign-intelligence service. He favors bolstering systems for detecting intruders once they’re inside.\n\n“We are not going to keep a nation-state attacker who has targeted you out,” said Williams, president of Rendition Infosec. “They are going to outfox you.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe question then becomes: How best to keep a network intrusion from becoming a catastrophe?\n\nWhy didn’t anyone do something sooner?\n\nAs this debate plays out within the cybersecurity community, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Microsoft and FireEye last month to explain how a security weakness publicized years ago was not addressed before the Russians took advantage of it. Microsoft released a tool to help detect such attacks less than two weeks after the Russian hack was publicly revealed.\n\n“The American people deserve to know why hackers were able to steal encryption keys from the U.S. government without anyone noticing,” Wyden said in a statement to The Washington Post. “I want to know why Microsoft didn’t provide its customers with tools to better protect and detect the theft of encryption keys, and why government agencies failed to deploy their own defenses. I’m also interested in what steps FireEye took to warn Microsoft, its customers and the U.S. government about a vulnerability it knew about nearly two years ago.”\n\nBoth companies defended their handling of the Golden SAML Attack in replies to Wyden — FireEye by letter, Microsoft by video call — according to a Wyden aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss communications not yet made public.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn comments to The Post, the companies noted the multiple weaknesses the Russians exploited in their intrusions and also the difficulty creating effective defenses against hackers who already have penetrated networks so deeply that they can issue their own SAML tokens. Both companies said better overall security practices are key to defending against this and other attacks, ideally before the initial intrusions succeed.\n\nJohn Lambert, the head of Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center, said in an interview that the company long has recommended security measures that might have thwarted the Russians, such as stand-alone hardware to guard encryption keys, and that handling the issuance of SAML tokens through a cloud service, such as Microsoft’s Azure, would offer increased protection and potentially make hacks easier to detect.\n\nHe also said that some of the measures now under discussion among independent cybersecurity experts — such as installing the hardware modules Microsoft recommends for protecting encryption keys — would make a Golden SAML Attack harder to execute in the future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“Defending identity has always been foundational,” Lambert said. “I think if you go back to any set of attacks at any point of time in the past, compromise of identities, abuse of identities, has always been a common element. … Securing identities and the secrets that underpin them have always been important.\"\n\nFireEye’s role in publicizing the Golden SAML Attack was highlighted in a Microsoft post that specifically cited one of the hacking tools FireEye released in 2019, ADFSDump. The post said that Microsoft’s Defender software could, as of Dec. 20, send alerts when it detected ADFSDump and called it “the initial tool used” in the Russian hacks.\n\nMicrosoft later revised this characterization after The Post questioned FireEye about it, saying that the Russians used a hacking tool resembling ADFSDump but that it was unclear whether ADFSDump itself was the one. The company’s updated version of the post removed the reference to the FireEye tool, saying instead that Microsoft’s Defender software now had an alert to “detect techniques used to obtain the information needed in order to generate security tokens,\" as happened in last year’s Russian attack.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFireEye acknowledged that its engineers had raised alarm about Golden SAML Attacks and released a pair of hacking tools to exploit it during a security conference in Germany in March 2019. But the company said it found no evidence that these tools were used by the Russians, though it couldn’t rule out the possibility. The goal of releasing such tools is to help “red teams” of cybersecurity researchers probe networks for flaws that can be corrected before malicious hackers exploit them.\n\n“FireEye develops red team tools to help improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of successful attacks and by showing the defenders … how to counter them in an operational environment,” said Dan Wire, vice president of global communications for FireEye. “Like many security companies, we have an internal process for responsibly releasing tools, and we review each release on a case-by-case basis.”\n\nThe U.S. government response to the Russian hack, meanwhile, came under fire Tuesday when the heads of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Chairman Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Vice Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), sent a letter to the heads of the FBI, National Security Agency and other federal agencies demanding the appointment of “a clear leader” to coordinate the response.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“The federal government’s response so far has lacked the leadership and coordination warranted by a significant cyber event, and we have little confidence that we are on the shortest path to recovery,” they wrote.\n\nRussian spies began their attack by hacking SolarWinds, a Texas-based maker of network-monitoring software, and slipping what security experts call a “Trojan horse” into the networks of the company’s many clients during routine software updates. Once inside, the hackers roamed unchecked for months and might have stayed even longer had FireEye not found them within their own systems in December. That discovery triggered detection of the much wider, more troubling federal hack days later.\n\nMany experienced network defenders point to the introduction of the Solar Winds trojan — in what’s called a “supply-chain attack” — as the problem most urgently demanding attention because federal government systems rely on software produced by many private companies, each of which offers targets for malicious hackers. Once they get inside, experts say, there are numerous options, beyond just a Golden SAML Attack, to exploit a network’s systems for verifying user identities.\n\n“There are literally dozens upon dozens of ways,\" said Dmitri Alperovitch, who co-founded cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and now is executive chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “No one can possibly defend against all of them. … The idea that we should be chasing every single attack vector is a wrongheaded approach.”\n\nEarly alarm brought no response\n\nShaked Reiner, an Israeli cybersecurity expert who described the Golden SAML Attack in a 2017 blog post, said the method offers important advantages to hackers — namely its potential to enable unusually wide-ranging, long-lasting and hard-to-detect intrusions that may merit more robust defenses.\n\nThe initial blog post, made on the site of his employer, CyberArk Labs, initially generated only modest attention. News of the Russian hack, three years later, changed that. The National Security Agency cited Reiner’s post in its advisory on how to detect such intrusions on Dec. 17.\n\n“Right away, we understood. This is what we were talking about,” Reiner said.\n\nHe added that hackers deploying the Golden SAML Attack “can pretty much impersonate any user in a network. … Detecting this type of attack can be extremely difficult.”\n\nSome experts, including Green at Johns Hopkins, argue that sensitive government networks should invest in computer equipment called “hardware secure modules” that would house the encryption keys used to issue SAML tokens, making them almost impossible to steal. This equipment is expensive, ranging from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and can add significant complexity to the operation of cloud-computing networks — factors that have been barriers to their widespread adoption.\n\nAnother approach would be to specify a small number of computers — perhaps ones at the physical desks of system administrators — that can gain high-level access to the identity-management software itself. Even a skilled hacker, for example, would find it much harder to execute a Golden SAML Attack from Moscow if only a handful of computers were vulnerable to such manipulation from afar. Even then, key computers could be left disconnected from the Internet, adding more barriers to hackers operating remotely.\n\nSome other experts, however, say that even without actually stealing the encryption keys for issuing SAML tokens, hackers can still find ways to manipulate network identities in ways that allow them to expand and prolong intrusions.\n\nWilliams, of Rendition Infosec, said, “I agree that Microsoft could have done a better job of detecting any number of active-directory weaknesses or the exploitation of those weaknesses.”\n\nBut he added that more aggressive action by Microsoft, FireEye or others would have been unlikely to thwart the Russians, given their skills and resources.\n\n“I’m confident that wouldn’t have changed the outcome here,” Williams said.\n\nThe most viable solution for the future, some experts say, may be in better alarms to rapidly alert defenders to suspicious behavior, along with more extensive network logging of network activities — preferably activated by default — to assist the detective work after hacks inevitably occur.",

Those customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.\n\nThe hackers “primarily sought information related to certain government customers,” FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement, without naming them.

They can also use malicious software to wipe out data, as they reportedly did in 2014 to the Las Vegas Sands casino, whose staunchly pro-Israel owner Sheldon Adelson had suggested the United States drop nuclear bombs on Iran.\n\nArchrival Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco suffered a similar fate in 2012, when a cyberattack reportedly emanating from Iran wiped out the memories of tens of thousands of computers, crimping oil production. The company’s frantic efforts to recover reportedly drove up the price of hard drives worldwide.\n\nHackers with ties to Tehran can potentially hijack crucial machinery over the Internet, a tactic they experimented with at a New York state dam, whose control systems they penetrated in 2013. Or they could target sensitive political or diplomatic targets while mounting sophisticated information operations over Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms. Last October, Microsoft accused a group tied to the country’s government of attempting to identify, attack and breach personal email accounts associated with a U.S. presidential campaign, government officials and journalists.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd while the most appealing targets are likely to be in the U.S. homeland given Iran’s history of staging visible, politically potent attacks linked thematically to their grievances, it may be easier to strike U.S. military or diplomatic targets abroad, or similar targets in allied nations.\n\nCybersecurity expert James A. Lewis recently compiled a list of suspected Iranian hacks, cyberattacks and online spying incidents and was surprised to find 14 reported last year alone. The list included hacks aimed at the Trump campaign, telecommunications systems in Iraq, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, and intrusions into employee accounts of companies making and operating industrial control systems. Iranians also reportedly used LinkedIn to target users affiliated with Middle Eastern governments and workers within the financial and energy industries.\n\n“They have enough capability that they don’t need to ask, ‘Can we do this?’” said Lewis, a senior vice president for the Center for Strategic & International Studies. “It’s, ‘Do you want to do this?’”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExperts tracking online disinformation said Friday they had already seen suspicious, early signs of accounts pivoting to push messages sympathetic to the Iranian government. Some potentially suspect accounts on Instagram, for example, started tagging the White House in images featuring flag-draped coffins, according to the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. Meanwhile, apparently bogus claims of an airstrike at the Ain Al-Asad air base, which hosts U.S. forces in western Iraq, were spreading in hard-line Iranian media outlets, as well as on services including Twitter and Telegram, according to researchers.\n\n“This is a new era,” said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who chaired the countering foreign influence subcommittee of the Department of Homeland Security’s advisory council. “We always had controlled escalation policies with Iranians. Now these rules don’t exist, and the Iranians are going to usher in an era of unrestrained responses — an era that’s going to be filled with even more chaos.”\n\nThose responses, Soufan added, are likely to include cyber activities, as well as disinformation, which already saturates political and military conflict in the Middle East. “They have so many tools to make our existence in the Middle East and our interests and the interest of our allies really under threat.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlmost a year to the day before Trump ordered the attack on Soleimani, federal officials issued a sober assessment of Iran’s cyber prowess: A January 2019 intelligence report highlighted the country as an “espionage and attack threat,” with the ability to target U.S. officials, steal intelligence and disrupt “a large company’s corporate network for days to weeks.”\n\nIran’s cyber capabilities rank below those of Russia and China. But they have advanced significantly since 2010, the time of the discovery that a joint Israeli-U.S. operation had installed malicious software known as Stuxnet that destroyed centrifuges crucial to Iran’s nuclear ambitions.\n\nSince then, U.S. officials blame Iran for cyber attacks on “dozens of Saudi governmental and private-sector networks in late 2016 and early 2017,” and warn that targets in the United States similarly could be at risk.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn Iran bent on a visible, painful form of revenge could attempt several retaliatory actions in cyberspace, possibly as part of a broader campaign to drive American forces out of Iraq and enlist proxies and allies in wounding U.S. interests here and abroad.\n\n“The focus will be critical infrastructure — oil and gas in the Middle East, maybe elsewhere,” said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis for the cybersecurity company FireEye, adding that past operations have targeted the American financial sector. “Anywhere where they can cause serious, almost psychological effects, noticeable disruption. The purpose is to prove to the public that they can reach out and touch Americans.”\n\nAt the Department of Homeland Security, a top official said Friday that businesses and others should “brush up” on Iranian cyber tactics. Christopher C. Krebs, who leads DHS’s cybersecurity work, pointed to the agency’s past warnings that Iran is “looking to do much more than just steal data and money.” DHS did not respond to further request for comment. Neither did the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“We know that Iranian cyber operations are currently scoping and preparing to attack our networks — in all sectors of society — to see where they can hit us,” said Virginia Sen. Mark R. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nIn recent years, malicious actors tied to Iran, or to the country’s leaders, also have intensified their operations on Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. Through fake accounts — some of which masqueraded as journalists and even U.S. political figures — they pushed messages sympathetic to Tehran’s interests, at times opposing Trump.\n\n“Any time you get geopolitical tensions, you get an uptick in disinformation operations,” said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a social media analysis firm.\n\nAD\n\nOver the past two years, Facebook has announced six major Iran-related takedowns — involving more than 1,800 accounts, pages, and groups on its site and on Instagram, reaching 5 million users globally, according to an analysis of the company’s public statements. Twitter, meanwhile, has taken down thousands of accounts linked to Iran that had violated its rules.\n\nAD\n\nIran’s efforts differ from those of Russia, which sought to stoke social and political unrest in the United States during the 2016 election. Russia “intends to engage in, and infiltrate, communities online,” and is politically agnostic, targeting users and causes across the spectrum, said Graham Brookie, the leader of the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab. Iran, by contrast, “presents a very specific worldview and has tended to try to persuade others to their side,” he said, particularly with anti-Israel, anti-U.S. and anti-Saudi messages.\n\nBrookie said DFRLab already has seen “social media accounts that were previously used for economic purposes, like selling sneakers, immediately repurposed for coordinated messaging that aligns directly with the Iranian government.\n\nAD\n\n“This is another large and effective proxy front we should expect escalation on,” he added.\n\nAD\n\nOn messaging apps, dueling narratives were already taking shape, according to Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute who was monitoring about 100,000 Persian-language channels on Telegram. Using regime-supporting channels, such as “Young soldiers of the soft war,” users were circulating images of Soleimani’s body and portraying the U.S. as an “evil force that just committed an act of terrorism.”\n\nThe government has a handful of options in addressing the elevated threat, experts said. These include aiming to track and intercept cyber operations as they’re developing, akin to efforts to predict and blunt maneuvering on the battlefield. Another imperative, they said, is sharing information with private businesses, which could end up bearing the brunt of the risk.\n\nThe experts said it was difficult to predict what an Iranian offensive in cyberspace would look like, given how quickly capabilities are evolving.\n\nBut they pointed to certain precedents, including the 2017 cyberattacks targeting government ministries, banks and companies in Ukraine. The operation, blamed on Russia by Western officials, had global ramifications and was described by the White House as “the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history.”\n\nWhile the U.S. has more extensive defenses, those remain untested against aggressive Iranian tactics.",

A Commerce Department spokesperson confirmed a \"breach in one of our bureaus\" and said \"we have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate.\" The FBI had no immediate comment.The Washington Post reported Sunday, citing three unnamed sources, that the two federal agencies and FireEye were all breached through the SolarWinds network management system.Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds confirmed Sunday in an email to The Associated Press that it has a \"potential vulnerability\" related to updates released earlier this year to its Orion products, which help organizations monitor their online networks for problems or outages.\"We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state,\" said SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson in a statement.The comprise is critical because SolarWinds would give a hacker \"God-mode\" access to the network, making everything visible, said Alperovitch.Last Tuesday, FireEye said that foreign government hackers with \"world-class capabilities\" broke into its network and stole offensive tools it uses to probe the defenses of its thousands of customers. Those customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.The hackers \"primarily sought information related to certain government customers,\" FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement, without naming them. He said there was no indication they got customer information from the company's consulting or breach-response businesses or threat-intelligence data it collects.Former NSA hacker Jake Williams said it seemed clear that both the Treasury Department and FireEye were hacked using the same vulnerability.\"The timing of the release here is, I think, not at all a coincidence,\" said Williams, the president of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec.He said FireEye surely told the FBI and other federal partners how it had been hacked and they determined that Treasury had been similarly compromised.\"I suspect that there's a number of other (federal) agencies we're going to hear from this week that have also been hit,\" Williams added.FireEye responded to the Sony and Equifax data breaches and helped Saudi Arabia thwart an oil industry cyberattack - and has played a key role in identifying Russia as the protagonist in numerous aggressions in the burgeoning netherworld of global digital conflict.Neither Mandia nor a FireEye spokesperson said when the company detected the hack or who might be responsible. But many in the cybersecurity community suspect Russia.",

(Ali Mohammadi/Bloomberg)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nThe U.S. must brace for Iran to launch bold cyberattacks designed to cause major financial damage or threaten American lives as retaliation for the killing of one of its top generals, cybersecurity experts say.\n\nSecurity experts tell The Cybersecurity 202 that Iran may be willing to cross dangerous boundaries in cyberspace: For instance, they warn, Iranian hackers could launch attacks that shut down electricity for some Americans, destroy important financial records or disrupt hospital or transportation systems in ways that threaten lives.\n\n“We’re in a more escalated situation than we’ve been in the past, and there are some serious questions about where the red lines are,” John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis for the cybersecurity company FireEye, told me. “They may not have a problem with people getting hurt at this point.”\n\nExperts are also warning Iran could launch widespread attacks against U.S. companies that encrypt their information and hold it for ransom or target U.S. government contractors to punish them for working with the Trump White House. Or they might target U.S. allies in the Middle East or U.S. diplomatic targets abroad, as my colleagues Tony Romm, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Craig Timberg reported.\n\n“We’re definitely in new territory,” Robert M. Lee, founder of the cybersecurity firm Dragos, which protects major industrial systems, and a former National Security Agency official, told me.\n\nIran has routinely tested the boundaries of what it could get away with in cyberspace, including pummeling U.S. banks after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions in 2012 and hacking control systems at a New York dam in 2013. It also allegedly wiped data from tens of thousands of computers at the Saudi state oil company Aramco in 2012 in one of the most destructive digital attacks ever launched.\n\nBut it's always stopped short of launching the most serious attacks on U.S. targets. Experts fear it may soon abandon this restraint since the killing of Quds Force Commander Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani — who the Trump administration charged was planning major attacks against U.S. targets.\n\nStill, there are limits to Iran's capabilities. Lee says Iranian hackers aren’t sophisticated enough to launch an attack that could affect the whole nation; shutting off large portions of the electrical grid is not the true concern here. But they could disrupt electricity on a smaller scale, for instance, by targeting a U.S. city or portions of it. That could succeed by prompting widespread fear about a larger attack and, possibly, draw the U.S. into an even broader conflict by triggering an outsize response.\n\n“It’s really hard to do these attacks, and you shouldn’t expect to see major blackouts across the U.S. as a whole,” Lee said. “My concern is that they’ll get a small win and we’ll overreact.”\n\nIranian hackers have gained access to U.S. industrial companies’ computer networks in the past, Lee told me, but there’s no public evidence they’ve launched destructive hacks once they’re in there.\n\nHultquist made a similar point on Twitter:\n\nAnother facet of the Iranian cyberthreat is the cyberattack (disruptive/destructive) capability posed by Iran. Will they cripple our society? I highly doubt it. Could they score some major blows against individual companies and maybe even the US sense of security? Absolutely. 5/x — John Hultquist (@JohnHultquist) January 5, 2020\n\nGovernment officials are also sounding alarms. Just hours after Friday's U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani, the Department of Homeland Security’s top cybersecurity official, Chris Krebs, warned U.S. businesses to raise their defenses against Iranian hacks.\n\nGiven recent developments, re-upping our statement from the summer.\n\n\n\nBottom line: time to brush up on Iranian TTPs and pay close attention to your critical systems, particularly ICS. Make sure you’re also watching third party accesses! https://t.co/4G1P0WvjhS — Chris Krebs (@CISAKrebs) January 3, 2020\n\nBy Saturday evening, Krebs’s agency was also monitoring the hack of a minor government website run by the Government Publishing Office, which was defaced with propaganda for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. There’s no confirmation tracing the hack to the Iranian government, agency spokeswoman Sara Sendek told me.\n\nSen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, also urged DHS to ramp up preparations for an Iranian cyberattack and called on the White House to brief Congress on its plans.\n\nI’ve called for the Administration to brief Congress on their plan to keep Americans safe and I spoke with @DHS_Wolf about efforts to protect against cyber-attacks and other potential strikes in the US. — Senator Gary Peters (@SenGaryPeters) January 4, 2020\n\nTensions ratcheted up dramatically over the weekend with Iran suspending its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal. Trump warned that if Iran took military action against the U.S., he would target Iranian cultural sites, which would constitute a war crime under international law.\n\nIran may want to delay any damaging cyberattacks until it’s clear how far the conflict will escalate, experts say. That’s especially likely because most highly damaging cyberattacks require months of advance work to surreptitiously break into a company’s computer networks ⁠— and attackers can only strike once before they’re discovered and kicked out.\n\n“Iran will definitely use everything they have at their disposal eventually, but I don’t think a major cyberattack right this second makes sense,” Jake Williams, founder of the cybersecurity company Rendition Infosec and a former National Security Agency official told me. “Every piece of malware Iran uses now removes a bullet they can fire later to have a greater effect.”\n\nThere’s also a possibility, however, that Iran will be extra careful about crossing red lines with a cyberattack out of fear the Trump administration will retaliate much more aggressively than expected.\n\nThe Obama administration was wary of escalating hacking conflicts or of responding with military force, preferring to rely on indictments, sanctions and diplomatic tools. The Trump administration, however, has been much less predictable. Already on Sunday, Trump was warning that his administration might respond to Iranian attacks “in a disproportionate manner” — another possible violation of international law.\n\n“All the lines are completely obliterated with this administration, and you don’t know how they’re going to react,” said Tony Cole, chief technology officer at Attivo Networks. “So [Iran] is going to have to tread carefully.”\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

                        "docText": "The revelation that elite cyber spies in past months conducted the largest hack against US officials in years has put the spotlight on SolarWinds, the Texas-based company whose software was compromised while servicing some of the biggest agencies and companies in the United States.\n\nSolarWinds provides computer networking monitoring services to corporations and government agencies around the world, and has become a dominant player since it was founded in 1999.\n\n“They’re not a household name the same way that Microsoft is. That’s because their software sits in the back office,” said Rob Oliver, a research analyst at Baird who has followed the company for years. “Workers could have spent their whole career without hearing about SolarWinds. But I guarantee your IT department will know about it.”\n\nThe firm was founded by two brothers in Tulsa, Oklahoma, ahead of the feared turn-of-the-millennium Y2K computer bug. On an October earning call, the company’s chief executive Kevin Thompson touted how far it had come since.\n\nThere was not a database or an IT deployment model out there to which the company did not provide some level of monitoring or management, he told analysts. “We don’t think anyone else in the market is really even close in terms of the breadth of coverage we have,” he said. “We manage everyone’s network gear.“\n\nThat dominance, however, has become a liability. On Sunday, SolarWinds alerted thousands of its customers that an “outside nation state” had found a back door into its most popular product, a tool called Orion that helps organizations monitor outages on their computer networks and servers.\n\nThe company revealed that hackers snuck a malicious code that gave them remote access to customers’ networks into an update of Orion. The hack began as early as March, SolarWinds admitted, giving the hackers plenty of time to access the customers’ internal workings.\n\nThe breach was not discovered until the prominent cybersecurity company FireEye, which itself uses SolarWinds, determined it had experienced a breach through the software. FireEye has not publicly blamed that breach on the SolarWinds hack, but it reportedly confirmed that was the case to the tech site Krebs On Security on Tuesday.\n\nFireEye described the malware’s dizzying capabilities, from initially lying dormant up to two weeks, to hiding in plain sight by masquerading its reconnaissance forays as Orion activity.\n\nThe impact of the hack is not yet clear. US government officials have not yet stated which agencies were affected. But the treasury and commerce departments were confirmed to have been targeted.\n\nSolarWinds estimated in a financial filing that about 18,000 customers had installed the compromised software, meaning many of them were vulnerable to spy operations at some time this year.\n\nThe company earlier this week took down a web page that boasted of dozens of its best-known customers, from the White House, Pentagon and the Secret Service to the McDonald’s restaurant chain and Smithsonian museums.\n\n“We may not know the true impact for many months, if not more, if not ever,” said Kim Peretti, who co-chairs Atlanta-based law firm Alston & Bird’s cybersecurity preparedness and response team.\n\nFireEye, without naming any specific targets, has said it has confirmed infections in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, including in the health care and oil and gas industry, and has been informing affected customers around the world.\n\nThe breach has caused a crisis for SolarWinds. The compromised product accounts for nearly half the company’s annual revenue, which totaled $753.9m over the first nine months of this year. Its stock has plummeted 23% since the beginning of the week.\n\nMoody’s Investors Service said Wednesday it was looking to downgrade its rating for the company, citing the “potential for reputational damage, material loss of customers, a slowdown in business performance and high remediation and legal costs”.\n\nSolarWinds’ longtime CEO, Kevin Thompson, had months earlier indicated that he would be leaving at the end of the year as the company explored spinning off one of its divisions. The SolarWinds board appointed his replacement just a day before FireEye first publicly revealed the hack.\n\n“This is an unimaginable, unfortunate situation,” said Oliver, the research analyst. “SolarWinds products have always been reliable. Its value proposition has been around reliability.”\n\nSolarWinds executives declined interviews through a spokesperson, who cited an ongoing investigation that now involves the FBI and other agencies.\n\nIn a statement issued to Retuers on Sunday, the company said “we strive to implement and maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, security processes, procedures, and standards designed to protect our customers.”",

The post said “red team tools” were stolen as part of a highly sophisticated, probable “nation-state” hacking operation. It is not clear exactly when the hack initially took place.\n\nBeyond the tool theft, the hackers also appeared to be interested in a subset of FireEye customers: government agencies.\n\n“We hope that by sharing the details of our investigation, the entire community will be better equipped to fight and defeat cyber-attacks,” Mandia wrote.\n\nThe company itself has partnered in recent weeks with different software makers to share defensive measures.\n\nThere is no evidence yet that FireEye’s hacking tools have been used or that client data was exfiltrated. But the investigation, which includes help from the FBI and Microsoft, is in its early phases.\n\n“This incident demonstrates why the security industry must work together to defend against and respond to threats posed by well-funded adversaries using novel and sophisticated attack techniques,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.\n\nThe FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe stolen computer espionage kit targets a myriad of different vulnerabilities in popular software products. It is not yet clear exactly which systems may be affected.\n\nBut Mandia wrote that none of the red team tools exploited so-called “zero day vulnerabilities”, meaning the relevant flaws should already be public.\n\nExperts say it can be difficult to measure the impact of a hacking tool leak which focuses on known software vulnerabilities. When a private company becomes aware of a vulnerability in their software product, they often try to offer a “patch” or upgrade that nullifies the issue. Yet users do not always download these patches quickly, leaving themselves exposed for months or weeks.\n\n“We are not sure if the attacker intends to use our Red Team tools or to publicly disclose them,” Mandia wrote.\n\nMark Warner, the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate select committee on intelligence, said: “The hack of a premier cybersecurity firm demonstrates that even the most sophisticated companies are vulnerable to cyber-attacks.\n\n“We have come to expect and demand that companies take real steps to secure their systems, but this case also shows the difficulty of stopping determined nation-state hackers. As we have with critical infrastructure, we have to rethink the kind of cyber assistance the government provides to American companies in key sectors on which we all rely.”",

Many experts suspect Russia is responsible for the attack against FireEye, a major cybersecurity player whose customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.\n\nThe apparent conduit for the Treasury and Commerce Department hacks — and the FireEye compromise — is a hugely popular piece of server software called SolarWinds. It is used by hundreds of thousands of organisations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple U.S. government agencies who will now be scrambling to patch up their networks, said Mr. Alperovitch, the former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.\n\nThe attacks were disclosed less than a week after a National Security Agency advisory warned that Russian government hackers were exploiting vulnerabilities in a system used by the federal government, “allowing the actors access to protected data.”\n\nThe U.S. government did not publicly identify Russia as the culprit behind the hacks, first reported by Reuters, and said little about who might be responsible.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said in a statement that the government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.”\n\nThe government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said separately that it has been working with other agencies “regarding recently discovered activity on government networks.

Many experts suspect Russia is responsible for the attack against FireEye , a major cybersecurity player whose customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.The apparent conduit for the Treasury and Commerce Department hacks - and the FireEye compromise - is a hugely popular piece of server software called SolarWinds . It is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple U.S. government agencies who will now be scrambling to patch up their networks, said Alperovitch, the former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.The attacks were disclosed less than a week after a National Security Agency advisory warned that Russian government hackers were exploiting vulnerabilities in a system used by the federal government, \"allowing the actors access to protected data.\"The U.S. government did not publicly identify Russia as the culprit behind the hacks, first reported by Reuters, and said little about who might be responsible.National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said in a statement that the government was \"taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.\"The government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said separately that it has been working with other agencies \"regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.\"President Donald Trump last month fired the director of CISA, Chris Krebs, after Krebs vouched for the integrity of the presidential election and disputed Trump's claims of widespread electoral fraud.In a tweet Sunday, Krebs said \"hacks of this type take exceptional tradecraft and time\" and raised the possibility that it had been underway for months.\"This thing is still early, I suspect,\" Krebs wrote.Federal government agencies have long been attractive targets for foreign hackers.Hackers linked to Russia were able to break into the State Department 's email system in 2014, infecting it so thoroughly that it had to be cut off from the internet while experts worked to eliminate the infestation.Reuters earlier reported that a group backed by a foreign government stole information from Treasury and a Commerce Department agency responsible for deciding internet and telecommunications policy.The Treasury Department deferred comment to the National Security Council. A Commerce Department spokesperson confirmed a \"breach in one of our bureaus\" and said \"we have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate.\" The FBI had no immediate comment.The Washington Post reported Sunday, citing three unnamed sources, that the two federal agencies and FireEye were all breached through the SolarWinds network management system.Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds confirmed Sunday in an email to The Associated Press that it has a \"potential vulnerability\" related to updates released earlier this year to its Orion products, which help organizations monitor their online networks for problems or outages.\"We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state,\" said SolarWinds CEO Kevin Thompson in a statement.The comprise is critical because SolarWinds would give a hacker \"God-mode\" access to the network, making everything visible, said Alperovitch.Last Tuesday, FireEye said that foreign government hackers with \"world-class capabilities\" broke into its network and stole offensive tools it uses to probe the defenses of its thousands of customers. Those customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.The hackers \"primarily sought information related to certain government customers,\" FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said in a statement, without naming them. He said there was no indication they got customer information from the company's consulting or breach-response businesses or threat-intelligence data it collects.Former NSA hacker Jake Williams said it seemed clear that both the Treasury Department and FireEye were hacked using the same vulnerability.\"The timing of the release here is, I think, not at all a coincidence,\" said Williams, the president of the cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec.He said FireEye surely told the FBI and other federal partners how it had been hacked and they determined that Treasury had been similarly compromised.\"I suspect that there's a number of other (federal) agencies we're going to hear from this week that have also been hit,\" Williams added.FireEye responded to the Sony and Equifax data breaches and helped Saudi Arabia thwart an oil industry cyberattack - and has played a key role in identifying Russia as the protagonist in numerous aggressions in the burgeoning netherworld of global digital conflict.Neither Mandia nor a FireEye spokesperson said when the company detected the hack or who might be responsible.

                        "docText": "Cybersecurity researchers had warned for years that such an attack was possible. Those from one firm, FireEye, even released hacking tools in 2019 showing exactly how to do it — in hopes that the revelation would spur the widespread deployment of better defenses.\n\nIt didn’t.\n\nNow there is urgent debate within cybersecurity circles about how best to respond to the hack, which was so extensive that experts describe it as historic.\n\nAD\n\nSome are calling for stronger walls to keep out would-be intruders or better burglar alarms to alert network administrators that a hack had begun. Others, arguing that there’s no practical way to keep the most sophisticated hackers from breaking into important networks, say the smarter investment would be in building better tools for hunting and ejecting intruders once they inevitably get past security perimeters.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, questions remain about why this surge of corrective action didn’t happen earlier for a type of hack that had been discussed for years within cybersecurity circles and whether, even now, the potential solutions are being deployed widely enough to prevent future catastrophes.\n\nTwo months after the hack was discovered in December, cybersecurity researchers say spies are probably still active in some of the hundreds of breached networks. Victims included the departments of State, Treasury, Homeland Security, Energy and Commerce, and the National Institutes of Health and the National Nuclear Security Administration. Also penetrated were private companies in the consulting, technology, telecom, and oil and gas companies in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as well as FireEye itself, which first reported the attack on Dec. 8.\n\nThe Russians used a variety of sophisticated tricks to penetrate the networks in last year’s attack. But once inside, they often manipulated a piece of Microsoft software, Active Directory Federation Services, that vouches for the identities of authorized users by issuing digital identity documents called “SAML tokens.” An Israeli researcher had first described this technique, dubbed a “Golden SAML Attack,” in 2017, but it had not been seen in a major network intrusion until now, experts say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch systems for authenticating users are essential to securing the cloud services used widely by government agencies, corporations, hospitals, universities and most other places where people collaborate across long distances. And the ability to forge SAML tokens lets hackers roam widely among these cloud-based services, while also minimizing the chances of getting quickly caught.\n\n“All of this outward security doesn’t mean squat if you don’t have this one thing locked up,” said Matthew D. Green, a Johns Hopkins cybersecurity and cryptology expert. “This is crazy.\"\n\nAuthenticated SAML (rhymes with “camel”) tokens let intruders move easily among the computer systems affiliated with an organization, even if the individual elements are run by different companies, such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services or Dropbox. Hackers can present these tokens as they seek access to different troves of valuable data — email, document repositories, payroll systems — while sidestepping common defensive measures, such as strong passwords and two-factor authentication.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are possible protections against a Golden SAML Attack, including securing the encryption keys that create the tokens in their own, well-defended piece of hardware, or sharply limiting who has high-level access to the computers authorized to issue tokens. Alerts warning of unusual behavior might help defenders act more quickly, and more extensive logging could help the detective work after signs of trouble are detected.\n\nFormer National Security Agency hacker Jake Williams said his security consultancy has been helping clients respond to the recent Russian attack. But even now, it’s not entirely clear to him which defenses are best suited to prevent a repeat, given the sophistication of the attackers, which U.S. officials have said were from the SVR, Russian’s foreign-intelligence service. He favors bolstering systems for detecting intruders once they’re inside.\n\n“We are not going to keep a nation-state attacker who has targeted you out,” said Williams, president of Rendition Infosec. “They are going to outfox you.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe question then becomes: How best to keep a network intrusion from becoming a catastrophe?\n\nWhy didn’t anyone do something sooner?\n\nAs this debate plays out within the cybersecurity community, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Microsoft and FireEye last month to explain how a security weakness publicized years ago was not addressed before the Russians took advantage of it. Microsoft released a tool to help detect such attacks less than two weeks after the Russian hack was publicly revealed.\n\n“The American people deserve to know why hackers were able to steal encryption keys from the U.S. government without anyone noticing,” Wyden said in a statement to The Washington Post. “I want to know why Microsoft didn’t provide its customers with tools to better protect and detect the theft of encryption keys, and why government agencies failed to deploy their own defenses. I’m also interested in what steps FireEye took to warn Microsoft, its customers and the U.S. government about a vulnerability it knew about nearly two years ago.”\n\nBoth companies defended their handling of the Golden SAML Attack in replies to Wyden — FireEye by letter, Microsoft by video call — according to a Wyden aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss communications not yet made public.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn comments to The Post, the companies noted the multiple weaknesses the Russians exploited in their intrusions and also the difficulty creating effective defenses against hackers who already have penetrated networks so deeply that they can issue their own SAML tokens. Both companies said better overall security practices are key to defending against this and other attacks, ideally before the initial intrusions succeed.\n\nJohn Lambert, the head of Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center, said in an interview that the company long has recommended security measures that might have thwarted the Russians, such as stand-alone hardware to guard encryption keys, and that handling the issuance of SAML tokens through a cloud service, such as Microsoft’s Azure, would offer increased protection and potentially make hacks easier to detect.\n\nHe also said that some of the measures now under discussion among independent cybersecurity experts — such as installing the hardware modules Microsoft recommends for protecting encryption keys — would make a Golden SAML Attack harder to execute in the future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“Defending identity has always been foundational,” Lambert said. “I think if you go back to any set of attacks at any point of time in the past, compromise of identities, abuse of identities, has always been a common element. … Securing identities and the secrets that underpin them have always been important.\"\n\nFireEye’s role in publicizing the Golden SAML Attack was highlighted in a Microsoft post that specifically cited one of the hacking tools FireEye released in 2019, ADFSDump. The post said that Microsoft’s Defender software could, as of Dec. 20, send alerts when it detected ADFSDump and called it “the initial tool used” in the Russian hacks.\n\nMicrosoft later revised this characterization after The Post questioned FireEye about it, saying that the Russians used a hacking tool resembling ADFSDump but that it was unclear whether ADFSDump itself was the one. The company’s updated version of the post removed the reference to the FireEye tool, saying instead that Microsoft’s Defender software now had an alert to “detect techniques used to obtain the information needed in order to generate security tokens,\" as happened in last year’s Russian attack.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFireEye acknowledged that its engineers had raised alarm about Golden SAML Attacks and released a pair of hacking tools to exploit it during a security conference in Germany in March 2019. But the company said it found no evidence that these tools were used by the Russians, though it couldn’t rule out the possibility. The goal of releasing such tools is to help “red teams” of cybersecurity researchers probe networks for flaws that can be corrected before malicious hackers exploit them.\n\n“FireEye develops red team tools to help improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of successful attacks and by showing the defenders … how to counter them in an operational environment,” said Dan Wire, vice president of global communications for FireEye. “Like many security companies, we have an internal process for responsibly releasing tools, and we review each release on a case-by-case basis.”\n\nThe U.S. government response to the Russian hack, meanwhile, came under fire Tuesday when the heads of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Chairman Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Vice Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), sent a letter to the heads of the FBI, National Security Agency and other federal agencies demanding the appointment of “a clear leader” to coordinate the response.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“The federal government’s response so far has lacked the leadership and coordination warranted by a significant cyber event, and we have little confidence that we are on the shortest path to recovery,” they wrote.\n\nRussian spies began their attack by hacking SolarWinds, a Texas-based maker of network-monitoring software, and slipping what security experts call a “Trojan horse” into the networks of the company’s many clients during routine software updates. Once inside, the hackers roamed unchecked for months and might have stayed even longer had FireEye not found them within their own systems in December. That discovery triggered detection of the much wider, more troubling federal hack days later.\n\nMany experienced network defenders point to the introduction of the Solar Winds trojan — in what’s called a “supply-chain attack” — as the problem most urgently demanding attention because federal government systems rely on software produced by many private companies, each of which offers targets for malicious hackers. Once they get inside, experts say, there are numerous options, beyond just a Golden SAML Attack, to exploit a network’s systems for verifying user identities.\n\n“There are literally dozens upon dozens of ways,\" said Dmitri Alperovitch, who co-founded cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and now is executive chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “No one can possibly defend against all of them. … The idea that we should be chasing every single attack vector is a wrongheaded approach.”\n\nEarly alarm brought no response\n\nShaked Reiner, an Israeli cybersecurity expert who described the Golden SAML Attack in a 2017 blog post, said the method offers important advantages to hackers — namely its potential to enable unusually wide-ranging, long-lasting and hard-to-detect intrusions that may merit more robust defenses.\n\nThe initial blog post, made on the site of his employer, CyberArk Labs, initially generated only modest attention. News of the Russian hack, three years later, changed that. The National Security Agency cited Reiner’s post in its advisory on how to detect such intrusions on Dec. 17.\n\n“Right away, we understood. This is what we were talking about,” Reiner said.\n\nHe added that hackers deploying the Golden SAML Attack “can pretty much impersonate any user in a network. … Detecting this type of attack can be extremely difficult.”\n\nSome experts, including Green at Johns Hopkins, argue that sensitive government networks should invest in computer equipment called “hardware secure modules” that would house the encryption keys used to issue SAML tokens, making them almost impossible to steal. This equipment is expensive, ranging from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and can add significant complexity to the operation of cloud-computing networks — factors that have been barriers to their widespread adoption.\n\nAnother approach would be to specify a small number of computers — perhaps ones at the physical desks of system administrators — that can gain high-level access to the identity-management software itself. Even a skilled hacker, for example, would find it much harder to execute a Golden SAML Attack from Moscow if only a handful of computers were vulnerable to such manipulation from afar. Even then, key computers could be left disconnected from the Internet, adding more barriers to hackers operating remotely.\n\nSome other experts, however, say that even without actually stealing the encryption keys for issuing SAML tokens, hackers can still find ways to manipulate network identities in ways that allow them to expand and prolong intrusions.\n\nWilliams, of Rendition Infosec, said, “I agree that Microsoft could have done a better job of detecting any number of active-directory weaknesses or the exploitation of those weaknesses.”\n\nBut he added that more aggressive action by Microsoft, FireEye or others would have been unlikely to thwart the Russians, given their skills and resources.\n\n“I’m confident that wouldn’t have changed the outcome here,” Williams said.\n\nThe most viable solution for the future, some experts say, may be in better alarms to rapidly alert defenders to suspicious behavior, along with more extensive network logging of network activities — preferably activated by default — to assist the detective work after hacks inevitably occur.",

                        "docText": "BOSTON (AP) — It’s going to take months to kick elite hackers widely believed to be Russian out of the U.S. government networks they have been quietly rifling through since as far back as March in Washington’s worst cyberespionage failure on record.\n\nExperts say there simply are not enough skilled threat-hunting teams to identify all the government and private-sector systems that may have been hacked. FireEye, the cybersecurity company that discovered the worst-ever intrusion into U.S. agencies and was among the victims, has already tallied dozens of casualties. It's racing to identify more.\n\n“We have a serious problem. We don’t know what networks they are in, how deep they are, what access they have, what tools they left,” said Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert and Harvard fellow.\n\nIt’s not known exactly what the hackers were seeking, but experts say it could include nuclear secrets, blueprints for advanced weaponry and information for dossiers on key government and industry leaders.\n\nThat means many federal workers — and others in the private sector — will have to presume that unclassified networks are teeming with spies. Agencies will often have to conduct sensitive government business on Signal, WhatsApp and other encrypted smartphone apps.\n\n“We should buckle up. This will be a long ride,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technical officer of the leading cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. “Cleanup is just phase one.”\n\nThe only way to be sure a network is clean is “to burn it down to the ground and rebuild it,” Schneier said. It’s the only way to be sure an intruder is out.\n\nImagine a computer network as a mansion you inhabit, and you are certain a serial killer as been there. “You don’t know if he’s gone. How do you get work done? You kind of just hope for the best,” he said.\n\nDeputy White House press secretary Brian Morgenstern told reporters Friday that national security adviser Robert O’Brien has sometimes been leading multiple daily meetings with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community, looking for ways to mitigate the hack.\n\nHe would not provide details, “but rest assured we have the best and brightest working hard on it each and every single day.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has downplayed the Russian cyberthreat after refusing to accept that a Kremlin hack-and-leak operation favored him in the 2016 election, has said nothing publicly about the SolarWinds attack. But Morgenstern said he has been briefed.\n\nThere is little incentive for the White House to disclose which agencies were hacked. That only helps U.S. adversaries, national security experts said.\n\nWhat makes this hacking campaign so extraordinary is its scale — 18,000 organizations were infected from March to June by malicious code that piggybacked on popular network-management software from an Austin, Texas, company called SolarWinds.\n\nOnly a sliver of those infections were activated. FireEye says it has identified dozens, all “high-value targets.” Microsoft, which has helped respond, says it has identified more than 40 government agencies, think tanks, government contractors, non-governmental organizations and technology companies infiltrated by the hackers, 80% of them in the United States.\n\nSolarWinds’ customers include most prominent Fortune 500 companies, and it’s U.S. government clients are rich with generals and spymasters.\n\nExtracting the suspected Russian hackers’ tool kits from victims is exacerbated by the complexity of SolarWinds’ platform with its dozen different components.\n\n“This is like doing heart surgery, to pull this out of a lot of environments,” said Edward Amoroso, CEO of TAG Cyber.\n\nSecurity teams then have to assume that the patient is still sick with undetected so-called “secondary infections” and set up the cyber equivalent of closed-circuit monitoring to make sure the intruders are not still around, sneaking out internal emails and other sensitive data.\n\nThat effort will take months, Alperovitch said.\n\nIf the hackers are indeed from Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence agency, as experts believe, their resistance may be tenacious. When they hacked the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department in 2014 and 2015 “it was a nightmare to get them out,” Alperovitch said.\n\n“It was the virtual equivalent of hand-to-hand combat\" as defenders sought to keep their footholds, “to stay buried deep inside” and move to other parts of the network where \"they thought that they could remain for longer periods of time.”\n\n“We’re likely going to face the same in this situation as well,” he added.\n\nFireEye executive Charles Carmakal said the intruders are especially skilled at camouflaging their movements. Their software effectively does what a military spy often does in wartime — hide among the local population, then sneak out at night and strike.\n\n“It’s really hard to catch some of these,” he said.\n\nRob Knake, the White House cybersecurity director from 2011 to 2015, said the harm to the most critical agencies in the U.S. government — defense and intelligence, chiefly — from the SolarWinds hacking campaign is going to be limited “as long as there is no evidence that the Russians breached classified networks.”\n\nDuring the 2014-15 hack, “we lost access to unclassified networks but were able to move all operations to classified networks with minimal disruptions,” he said via email.\n\nThe Pentagon has said it has so far not detected any intrusions from the SolarWinds campaign in any of its networks — classified or unclassified.\n\nThe White House has been largely silent.\n\nGiven the fierce tenor of cyberespionage — the U.S., Russia and China all have formidable offensive hacking teams and have been penetrating each others’ government networks for years — many American officials are wary of putting anything sensitive on government networks.\n\nFiona Hill, the top Russia expert at the National Security Council during much of the Trump administration, said she always presumed no government system was secure. She “tried from the beginning not to put anything down” in writing that was sensitive.\n\n“But that makes it more difficult to do business.”\n\nAmoroso, of TAG Cyber, recalled the famous pre-election dispute in 2016 over classified emails sent over a private server set up by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. Clinton was investigated by the FBI in the matter, but no charges were brought.\n\n“I used to make the joke that the reason the Russians didn’t have Hillary Clinton’s email is because she took it off the official State Department network,” Amoroso said.",

It shows a cartoon with the text: “Hey look Russians” and “Putin did it!”\n\nThe opaque message itself did not help FireEye find the breach, but rather arrived in the early stages of its investigation. This has led people familiar with the matter to believe the sender was attempting to “troll” or push the company off the trail by intimidating a senior executive.\n\nReuters could not determine who sent the postcard. U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies are spearheading the probe into its origin, the sources familiar said.\n\nThe FBI did not provide comment. A FireEye representative declined to discuss the postcard.\n\nA disinformation researcher from the Rand Corporation, Todd Helmus, received a similar postcard in 2019, based on an image of it Helmus posted to Twitter. Helmus, who studies digital propaganda, said he received the postcard after testifying to Congress about Russian disinformation tactics.\n\nFireEye discovered the Russian hacking campaign - now known as “Solorigate” for how it leveraged supply chain vulnerabilities in network management firm Solarwinds - because of an anomalous device login from within FireEye’s network. The odd login triggered a security alert and subsequent investigation, which led to the discovery of the operation.\n\nFireEye worked closely with Microsoft to determine that the infiltration at FireEye in fact represented a hacking campaign that struck at least eight federal agencies including the Treasury, State and Commerce Departments.\n\nWhen the postcard was sent, FireEye had not yet determined who was behind the cyberattack. A person familiar with the postcard investigation said “this is not typically the Russian SVR’s playbook” but “times are rapidly changing.” SVR is an acronym for the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia.\n\nA former U.S. intelligence official said the postcard reminded him of a now public mission by U.S. Cyber Command where they sent private messages to Russian hackers ahead of the 2018 congressional elections in the United States.\n\n“The message then from the U.S. was ‘watch your back, we see you’ similar to here,” the former official said.\n\nThe extent of the damages tied to the U.S. government hack remains unclear. Emails belonging to senior officials were stolen from an unclassified network at the Treasury and Commerce Departments.",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) -Some of the world’s biggest private equity firms, including Blackstone Group Inc, Silver Lake Partners LP and Thoma Bravo LP, own major stakes in the software firms whose shares dived on news that they were breached by suspected Russian hackers.\n\nShares in SolarWinds Corp, which is controlled by Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo, were down more than 5% on Tuesday, after the information technology services provider said on Sunday that cyber spies hid malicious code in the body of legitimate software updates. SolarWind’s stock has slid 20.8% from last week’s close.\n\nReuters reported that Russian hackers hijacked the SolarWinds software updates to break into multiple U.S. government agencies. Moscow denied having any connection to the attacks.\n\nFollowing the plunge in the shares, Silver Lake’s nearly 40% stake in SolarWinds is worth $2.3 billion, while Thoma Bravo’s 33% stake is valued at $1.9 billion. They are still in the black, as each had invested $1.2 billion in the $4.5 billion leveraged buyout of SolarWinds in 2016. Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo have also earned $194.6 million and $234.67 million, respectively, from secondary stock sales since they took SolarWinds public in 2018.\n\nSilver Lake declined to comment. Thoma Bravo did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn November, Blackstone led a $400 million investment in cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc, with ClearSky, a cyber security-focused investment firm, joining as co-investor.\n\nFireEye shares dropped more than 11% earlier this month after the company said hackers stole an arsenal of internal hacking tools used to privately test the cyber defenses of its clients. FireEye has contracts across the U.S. national security sector and other allied countries.\n\nFollowing the breach, FireEye agreed to amend the deal to make it more favorable to Blackstone and ClearSky, according to regulatory filings. The FireEye preferred shares they stood to receive, paying a 4.5% dividend, would be converted into common stock at $17.25, not $18 as previously agreed. FireEye shares were trading on Tuesday afternoon around $13.58.\n\nBlackstone declined to comment.",

                        "docText": "On Dec. 8, the cybersecurity firm FireEye announced that hackers had broken into its servers and stolen sensitive security-testing tools as part of a breach they’d discovered in recent weeks. FireEye determined by Friday that SolarWinds’ updates had been corrupted and contacted the company shortly after, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nA SolarWinds spokesman declined to discuss timing or answer further questions about the trades.\n\nSolarWinds makes a popular set of network-management tools that companies and government agencies use to manage their increasingly complicated computer systems and watch for outages, slowdowns, bottlenecks and security breaches.\n\nBut the software’s intimate access to companies’ computer systems also made it a prized target for hackers, who, by altering a SolarWinds software update rolled out in March, gained a back door into thousands of sensitive corporate and government networks, including FireEye and the departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, State and Treasury.\n\nIt’s unknown when SolarWinds’s executives and insiders first learned of the hack. But a former enforcement official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and an accounting expert both said the trades would likely spark an investigation by federal securities watchdogs into whether they amounted to insider trading.\n\n“Of course the SEC is going to look at that,” said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former senior counsel in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Large trades in advance of a major announcement, then an announcement: That is a formula for an insider trading investigation.”\n\nFrenkel said a probe could take up to a year as investigators seek to determine whether insiders traded on information that “would be important to a reasonable investor.” Frenkel has no financial relationship to SolarWinds or its investors, he added.\n\nSilver Lake, a Silicon Valley investor with a history of high-profile tech deals including Airbnb, Dell and Twitter, sold $158 million in shares of SolarWinds on Dec. 7 — six days before news of the breach became public. Thoma Bravo, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, also sold $128 million of its shares in SolarWinds on Dec. 7.\n\nTogether, the two investment firms own 70 percent of SolarWinds and control six of the company’s board seats, giving the firms access to key information and making their stock trades subject to federal rules around financial disclosures.\n\nThree executives from Thoma Bravo are directors on the SolarWinds board: Seth Boro, James Lines and Michael Hoffman. Three executives from Silver Lake — Kenneth Hao, Michael Bingle and Mike Widmann — are also on the board.\n\nIt was both investors’ largest sale of SolarWinds stock since the company went public in 2018. Last year, Silver Lake sold about $140 million and Thoma Bravo sold about $110 million in shares, according to regulatory filings.\n\nSilver Lake and Thoma Bravo were not briefed on the security breach until Saturday Dec. 12, people familiar with those investment firms said.\n\nChandler Smith Costello, a spokeswoman for the SEC, declined to comment.\n\nThe trades also occurred just before SolarWinds announced that its chief executive since 2010, Kevin Thompson, was resigning. The company said in an August securities filing that it would look for a new CEO as part of a preplanned transition but had given no date for the switch.\n\nThe sequence of events could also raise questions about whether investors traded on inside information about the change in leadership, said Daniel Taylor, a professor of accounting at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The largest stock sales happened on Dec. 7, the same day Thompson resigned, but two days before the company’s announcement of its new CEO.\n\n“Naming a CEO is certainly a material development, and board members almost certainly would have known of that in advance,” said Taylor, whose research focuses on insider trading.\n\nThompson, the outgoing CEO, also sold more than $15 million in shares of SolarWinds last month, according to filings. Those transactions were part of a preplanned schedule of stock trading, the filings said.\n\nThe company has said that Sudhakar Ramakrishna, a former executive of the software companies Citrix Systems and Pulse Secure, will take over after Thompson’s resignation takes effect at the end of the year.\n\nThe 21-year-old SolarWinds collected more than $900 million in revenue last year, thanks largely to an explosion of business from industry and U.S. government agencies. The SolarWinds product that was compromised, Orion, brought in roughly $343 million in the first nine months of this year, 45 percent of the company’s total revenue for that period, the company said in a federal securities filing Monday.\n\n“We don’t think anyone else in the market is really even close in terms of the breadth of coverage we have,” Thompson said on a call with investment analysts in October. “You name a database, you name a deployment model, we now provide not just some level of monitoring and management, but a deep level of monitoring and management. … We manage everyone’s network gear.”\n\nBut hackers, cybersecurity experts said, were able to exploit Orion’s deep access by altering a software update that the company began rolling out to clients’ computers between March and June of this year. The subsequent cyberespionage campaign lasted months.\n\nSolarWinds said in the Monday filing that “fewer than 18,000” of its more than 300,000 customers may have been affected. But even that set could have disastrous implications because the company has said it provides software to the U.S. military, the Pentagon, the White House, the Federal Reserve and most of the big companies in the Fortune 500.\n\nDHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Monday issued a rare emergency directive ordering every federal agency to immediately disconnect any computer running Orion software.\n\nSolarWinds has not said when precisely it learned of the intrusion. In its filing Monday, the company said only that it “was made aware of an attack vector” used in the breach.\n\nOn Saturday, the National Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the breach, according to Reuters, which first reported the breach Sunday.\n\nOn Sunday night, SolarWinds announced the vulnerability and noted a “highly sophisticated, targeted, and manual supply chain attack by an outside nation state.” The company said it was working with the FBI, the intelligence community and law enforcement to investigate the attack.\n\nThe attack was spearheaded by the same hacking group inside Russia’s foreign intelligence service that previously infiltrated the White House’s email servers, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post. Russia has denied involvement in the attack.",

                        "docText": "RESTON, Va. (AP) — Cyber sleuths have already blamed China for a hack that exposed tens of thousands of servers running its Exchange email program to potential hacks. The CEO of a prominent cybersecurity firm says it now seems clear China also unleashed an indiscriminate, automated second wave of hacking that opened the way for ransomware and other cyberattacks.\n\nThe second wave, which began Feb. 26, is highly uncharacteristic of Beijing's elite cyber spies and far exceeds the norms of espionage, said Kevin Mandia of FireEye. In its massive scale it diverges radically from the highly targeted nature of the original hack, which was detected in January.\n\n“You never want to see a modern nation like China that has an offense capability — that they usually control with discipline — suddenly hit potentially a hundred thousand systems,” Mandia said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nMandia said his company assesses based on the forensics that two groups of Chinese state-backed hackers — in an explosion of automated seeding — installed backdoors known as “web shells” on an as-yet undetermined number of systems. Experts fear a large number could easily be exploited for second-stage infections of ransomware by criminals, who also use automation to identify and infect targets.\n\nAcross the globe, cybersecurity teams are scrambling to identify and shore up hacked systems. The National Governors Association sent a rare alert to governors on Tuesday asking them amplify “both the severity of the threat and the next steps” local governments, businesses and operators of critical infrastructure should take.\n\nDavid Kennedy, CEO of the cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, tweeted Tuesday that resource-demanding programs that “mine” cryptocurrencies were being installed on some compromised Exchange servers.\n\nThe White House has called the overall hack an “active threat,” but so far has not urged tough action against China or differentiated between the two waves — at least not publicly. Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security offered immediate comment on whether they attribute the second wave to China.\n\nThe assessment of Mandia, who has been dealing with Chinese state-backed hackers since 1995 and has long had the ear of presidents and prime ministers, squares with that of Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technical officer of CrowdStrike, the other cybersecurity powerhouse in the Washington, D.C., area. Alperovitch says China needs to be immediately put on notice: Shut down those web shell implants and limit collateral.\n\nThe explosion of automated backdoor-creating hacks began five days before Microsoft issued a patch for the vulnerabilities first detected in late January by the cybersecurity firm Volexity. It had found evidence of the vulnerabilities being used as far back as Jan. 3 by Chinese state-backed hackers, who researchers say targeted think tanks, universities, defense contractors, law firms and infectious-disease research centers.\n\nSuddenly, all manner of organizations that run email servers were infected with web shells associated with known Chinese groups, who — knowing the patch was imminent — rushed to hit everything they could, said Mandia.\n\n“They could sense it was going to end-of-life soon, so they just went wild. They machine gun-fired down the stretch,” he said in an interview in FireEye's offices.\n\nIt's possible the second infection wave was not approved at the highest levels of China's government,\" Mandia said.\n\n“This doesn’t feel consistent with what they normally do,” he said. “A lot of times there’s a disconnect between senior leadership and front-line folks. All I can tell you is it was surprising to me to see four ‘zero days’ wantonly exploited,\" adding, \"If you could be exploited by this act, for the most part, you were.”\n\n“Zero days” are vulnerabilities that hackers discover and use to pry open secret doors in software. Their name derives from the countdown to patching that begins after they are deployed. In this case, it took Microsoft 28 days to produce a patch once it was notified.\n\nMandia cautioned that the mass hack is not apt to trigger any critical infrastructure failures or cost lives. \"It's not going to draw blood.” But it highlights how there are no rules of engagement in cyberspace, something governments urgently need to address “before something catastrophic happens.”\n\nCOVID Resources Coronavirus Map Tracking COVID-19 cases across the Bay Area and California.\n\nAsked for comment on Monday about allegations it was behind the hack, the Chinese Embassy in Washington pointed to remarks last week from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin saying that China “firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms.” He said attribution of cyberattacks should be based on evidence and not “groundless accusations.”\n\nMandia compared the Exchange hack with the SolarWinds hacking campaign that Washington has blamed on elite Russian intelligence agents that his company discovered in December.\n\n“The SolarWinds attack was very surreptitious, very stealthy, very focused. The operator showed restraint and they went deep not wide,” said Mandia, who appeared in multiple Capitol Hill hearings on SolarWinds. \"This attack (Exchange) feels very wide, but what I don’t have an answer to yet is just how deep it is.”\n\nU.S. officials say at least nine federal agencies and over 100 private sector targets were affected by the SolarWinds campaign, named after the Texas company whose network management software was used to seed malware to more than 18,000 customers. Only a small number were hacked during the campaign, which went eight months without being detected.\n\nMandia said Russian intelligence operatives had manually penetrated the networks of between 60 and 100 different victims. Security researchers say telecommunications and software companies and think tanks were especially hard hit.\n\n___\n\nBajak reported from Boston.

                        "docText": "WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - China's global attack on Microsoft's popular email software revealed last week and an equally sprawling Russian attack discovered three months ago have created a two-front war that threatens to overwhelm cybersecurity's emergency responders, according to former US officials and private security firms.\n\nThe coincidence of two far-reaching hacking campaigns launched by Russia and China, discovered just weeks apart, is now rippling across the global economy - swamping insurers, IT staff, and firms that specialise in hunting and ejecting hackers.\n\nThe twin hacking campaigns involve the US' two most powerful cyberspace adversaries, and both have led to emergency meetings of the White House National Security Council, in part because of the unusually wide net cast by the attackers.\n\nBut for the tens of thousands of companies that have been impacted by one or another of the attacks, the one-two punch has left them scrambling to secure their computer systems - in some cases from hackers who are piling on the original nation-state attacks.\n\n\"It's a race,\" said Mr Tom Burt, Microsoft's corporate vice-president for customer security & trust. \"Since the time we went public with the update's availability, we've seen the number of compromised customers just explode. It went up incredibly rapidly and continues to increase.\"\n\nMicrosoft Corp. disclosed on March 2 that suspected Chinese state-sponsored hackers were exploiting four previously unknown vulnerabilities in the company's widely used Exchange business email software and issued a patch for those systems.\n\nSince that disclosure, other hackers have used automated programs to scan the internet, in some cases looking for companies that have yet to install the fix. Some of those are criminal groups trying to re-purpose secret entry points that China installed in its numerous victims, according to cybersecurity companies monitoring the aftermath.\n\nThe close proximity of the Chinese and Russian attacks may not be a coincidence, security experts say. China may have timed its effort to take advantage of the distraction created by the Russian hack, which impacted as many as 18,000 customers of the Texas-based software maker SolarWinds Corp, including key government agencies.\n\n\"The attack on Microsoft Exchange is a cold and calculated assault,\" said Mr Lior Div, co-founder and chief executive officer of Cybereason, a Boston-based security company. \"The Chinese attackers know exactly what they are doing. The new administration has been distracted by investigations into another US adversary on the cyber battlefield - Russia - and its calculated breach against SolarWinds.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson said on Monday (March 8) that high-level members of US President Joe Biden's National Security Council worked through the weekend responding to the latest incident.\n\nAnd the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in an emergency advisory on Monday described hackers' exploitation of the flaws in Microsoft's email product as now \"widespread and indiscriminate\".\n\nFor months before they were caught in December, Russian state hackers used altered SolarWinds software to spy on at least nine US government agencies and hundreds of companies. China's hack has already claimed 60,000 victims globally, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, though some estimates have put the number of Exchange servers that could be vulnerable to infection at close to 300,000 worldwide.\n\n\"I can't think of an equivalent breach,\" Mr Alex Stamos, a cybersecurity consultant and the former head of security at Facebook, said of the Chinese attack. \"It's a combination of the kind of mass-exploitation you often see with unpatched home routers, but instead of crypto-miners who are having no impact, these attackers are able to get all an organisation's email.\"\n\nOne victim of the most recent attack is the European Banking Authority, which said on Monday that it had shut down its email systems while it carried out an investigation into a \"cyberattack\" on its Microsoft Exchange servers.\n\nMr Radu Burghelea, head of information technology, confirmed that the organisation had discovered malicious software on the servers but not yet detected the theft of any emails from them.\n\nThe tactics used by China in particular leave victims vulnerable to other hackers. Victims could have their IT systems locked up by ransomware gangs, the personal information of their customers and employees stolen and sold to identity thieves, or their computers used to attack others.\n\n\"Currently, most of what we have observed has been automated scanning and reconnaissance,\" said Mr Mat Gangwer, a senior director of managed threat response for Sophos Ltd, a British cybersecurity company. \"The real question will be, are these organisations able to patch, assess and clean their environments before more harmful actors, such as ransomware groups, begin leveraging\" the malicious code that's been installed on the servers, he added.\n\nThat job will fall to specialized security firms and in-house IT staff that are already exhausted from weeks of fighting off Russia's sprawling and sophisticated attack.\n\n\"What makes it even harder is that defenders are experiencing successive waves of attacks, and many have not been able to restore their environments to a safe operating condition, even though things may 'seem' normal,\" said Mr Michael Henry, chief executive officer of Texas-based Arbala Security Inc, describing his work with clients dealing with back-to-back issues of SolarWinds and now the Exchange server vulnerabilities.\n\nIn the most recent incident, companies can install the patch issued last week by Microsoft, but that doesn't mean the hackers will be gone. In some cases, specialised teams will need to scour the infected computer systems, looking for hidden entry points planted by the hackers in order to shut them out.\n\nFireEye Inc, a large US cybersecurity firm, is now responding to dozens of cases in the US, Europe and Asia in attacks involving the flawed Microsoft code. Still, with not enough experts available from FireEye and other firms, the impact of the latest wave of attacks could linger for weeks or even months.\n\n\"There will be backdoors sitting on Exchange servers for quite a while,\" said Mr Charles Carmakal, senior vice-president at FireEye.",
